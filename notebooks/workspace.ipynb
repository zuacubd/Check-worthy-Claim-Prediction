Trump.\\t0', '14\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', '15\\tCLINTON\\tHow are you, Donald?\\t0', '16\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', '17\\tHOLT\\tGood luck to you.\\t0', '18\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', \"19\\tHOLT\\tWell, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled.\\t0\", \"20\\tHOLT\\tWe are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics.\\t0\", '21\\tHOLT\\tI am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.\\t0', '22\\tHOLT\\tCandidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values.\\t0', \"23\\tHOLT\\tSo, let's begin.\\t0\", '24\\tHOLT\\tWe\\'re calling this opening segment \"Achieving Prosperity.\"\\t0', '25\\tHOLT\\tAnd central to that is jobs.\\t0', '26\\tHOLT\\tThere are two economic realities in America today.\\t0', \"27\\tHOLT\\tThere's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.\\t0\", '28\\tHOLT\\tHowever, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.\\t0', '29\\tHOLT\\tBeginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?\\t0', '30\\tCLINTON\\tWell, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.\\t0', \"31\\tCLINTON\\tThe central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.\\t0\", \"32\\tCLINTON\\tToday is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.\\t0\", '33\\tCLINTON\\tFirst, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.\\t0', '34\\tCLINTON\\tThat means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.\\t0', '35\\tCLINTON\\tI want us to invest in you.\\t0', '36\\tCLINTON\\tI want us to invest in your future.\\t0', '37\\tCLINTON\\tThat means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.\\t0', '38\\tCLINTON\\tWe also have to make the economy fairer.\\t0', \"39\\tCLINTON\\tThat starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.\\t0\", '40\\tCLINTON\\tI also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.\\t0', '41\\tCLINTON\\tIf you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.\\t0', '42\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.\\t0', \"43\\tCLINTON\\tI've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.\\t0\", \"44\\tCLINTON\\tSo let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.\\t0\", \"45\\tCLINTON\\tLet's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.\\t0\", '46\\tCLINTON\\tHow are we going to do it?\\t0', \"47\\tCLINTON\\tWe're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.\\t0\", \"48\\tCLINTON\\tFinally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.\\t0\", \"49\\tCLINTON\\tWe're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.\\t0\", '50\\tCLINTON\\tYou have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.\\t0', '51\\tCLINTON\\tI hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.\\t0', '52\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton, thank you.\\t0', '53\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump, the same question to you.\\t0', \"54\\tHOLT\\tIt's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers.\\t0\", '55\\tHOLT\\tYou have up to two minutes.\\t0', '56\\tTRUMP\\tThank you, Lester.\\t0', '57\\tTRUMP\\tOur jobs are fleeing the country.\\t0', \"58\\tTRUMP\\tThey're going to Mexico.\\t0\", \"59\\tTRUMP\\tThey're going to many other countries.\\t0\", '60\\tTRUMP\\tYou look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.\\t0', \"61\\tTRUMP\\tThey're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.\\t0\", '62\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we have a very good fight.\\t0', '63\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we have a winning fight.\\t0', \"64\\tTRUMP\\tBecause they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.\\t0\", \"65\\tTRUMP\\tSo we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.\\t0\", \"66\\tTRUMP\\tWhen you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.\\t0\", \"67\\tTRUMP\\tThey're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.\\t0\", '68\\tTRUMP\\tWith the United States, as he said, not so much.\\t0', '69\\tTRUMP\\tSo Ford is leaving.\\t1', '70\\tTRUMP\\tYou see that, their small car division leaving.\\t1', '71\\tTRUMP\\tThousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.\\t1', \"72\\tTRUMP\\tThey're all leaving.\\t0\", \"73\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we can't allow it to happen anymore.\\t0\", '74\\tTRUMP\\tAs far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.\\t0', \"75\\tTRUMP\\tWe probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.\\t0\", '76\\tTRUMP\\tBut we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.\\t0', '77\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.\\t0', '78\\tTRUMP\\tAll you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.\\t0', '79\\tTRUMP\\tThey left -- fired 1,400 people.\\t0', \"80\\tTRUMP\\tThey're going to Mexico.\\t0\", '81\\tTRUMP\\tSo many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.\\t0', '82\\tTRUMP\\tWe cannot let it happen.\\t0', \"83\\tTRUMP\\tUnder my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.\\t0\", \"84\\tTRUMP\\tThat's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.\\t0\", \"85\\tTRUMP\\tIt's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.\\t0\", '86\\tTRUMP\\tCompanies will come.\\t0', '87\\tTRUMP\\tThey will build.\\t0', '88\\tTRUMP\\tThey will expand.\\t0', '89\\tTRUMP\\tNew companies will start.\\t0', '90\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I look very, very much forward to doing it.\\t0', '91\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\\t0', '92\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton, would you like to respond?\\t0', '93\\tCLINTON\\tWell, I think that trade is an important issue.\\t0', \"94\\tCLINTON\\tOf course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.\\t0\", '95\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we need to have smart, fair trade deals.\\t0', '96\\tCLINTON\\tWe also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.\\t0', '97\\tCLINTON\\tAnd the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.\\t0', \"98\\tCLINTON\\tIn fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.\\t0\", \"99\\tCLINTON\\tI call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.\\t0\", '100\\tCLINTON\\tThat is not how we grow the economy.\\t0', \"101\\tCLINTON\\tWe just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.\\t0\", '102\\tCLINTON\\tI think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.\\t0', '103\\tCLINTON\\tI understand that.\\t0', \"104\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.\\t0\", \"105\\tCLINTON\\tHe started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.\\t1\", \"106\\tCLINTON\\tI don't buy that.\\t0\", '107\\tCLINTON\\tI have a different experience.\\t0', '108\\tCLINTON\\tMy father was a small-businessman.\\t0', '109\\tCLINTON\\tHe worked really hard.\\t0', '110\\tCLINTON\\tHe printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.\\t0', \"111\\tCLINTON\\tAnd so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.\\t0\", \"112\\tCLINTON\\tThat's the kind of economy I want us to see again.\\t0\", '113\\tHOLT\\tLet me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can.\\t0', \"114\\tHOLT\\tYou've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.\\t0\", '115\\tHOLT\\tHow are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?\\t0', '116\\tHOLT\\tHow, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?\\t0', \"117\\tTRUMP\\tWell, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.\\t1\", \"118\\tTRUMP\\tOur country's in deep trouble.\\t0\", \"119\\tTRUMP\\tWe don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.\\t0\", \"120\\tTRUMP\\tThey're the best, the best ever at it.\\t0\", \"121\\tTRUMP\\tWhat they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.\\t0\", '122\\tTRUMP\\tSo we have to do that.\\t0', '123\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to renegotiate our trade deals.\\t0', \"124\\tTRUMP\\tAnd, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.\\t0\", '125\\tTRUMP\\tLet me give you the example of Mexico.\\t0', '126\\tTRUMP\\tThey have a VAT tax.\\t0', \"127\\tTRUMP\\tWe're on a different system.\\t0\", \"128\\tTRUMP\\tWhen we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.\\t0\", '129\\tTRUMP\\tWhen they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.\\t0', \"130\\tTRUMP\\tWhen they sell into us, there's no tax.\\t0\", \"131\\tTRUMP\\tIt's a defective agreement.\\t0\", \"132\\tTRUMP\\tIt's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.\\t0\", '133\\tTRUMP\\tNow, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?\\t0', '134\\tTRUMP\\tGood.\\t0', '135\\tTRUMP\\tI want you to be very happy.\\t0', \"136\\tTRUMP\\tIt's very important to me.\\t0\", '137\\tTRUMP\\tBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.\\t0', \"138\\tTRUMP\\tShe's been doing this for 30 years.\\t0\", \"139\\tTRUMP\\tAnd why hasn't she made the agreements better?\\t0\", '140\\tTRUMP\\tThe NAFTA agreement is defective.\\t0', '141\\tTRUMP\\tJust because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...\\t0', '142\\tHOLT\\tLet me interrupt just a moment, but...\\t0', \"143\\tTRUMP\\tSecretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.\\t0\", '144\\tTRUMP\\tThey should have been doing this for years.\\t0', \"145\\tTRUMP\\tWhat's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.\\t0\", '146\\tTRUMP\\tWe cannot do it any longer, Lester.\\t0', '147\\tHOLT\\tBack to the question, though.\\t0', '148\\tHOLT\\tHow do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?\\t0', '149\\tHOLT\\tHow do you make them bring the jobs back?\\t0', \"150\\tTRUMP\\tWell, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.\\t0\", '151\\tTRUMP\\tThe companies are leaving.\\t0', '152\\tTRUMP\\tI could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.\\t0', \"153\\tTRUMP\\tThey're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.\\t0\", '154\\tTRUMP\\tAnd what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.\\t0', '155\\tTRUMP\\tWe wish you a lot of luck.\\t0', \"156\\tTRUMP\\tBut if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.\\t0\", \"157\\tTRUMP\\tAnd once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.\\t0\", \"158\\tTRUMP\\tSo what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.\\t0\", '159\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to stop them from leaving.\\t0', \"160\\tTRUMP\\tAnd that's a big, big factor.\\t0\", '161\\tHOLT\\tLet me let Secretary Clinton get in here.\\t0', \"162\\tCLINTON\\tWell, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.\\t0\", '163\\tCLINTON\\tWe had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.\\t0', '164\\tCLINTON\\tThat was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\\t0', '165\\tCLINTON\\tIn fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.\\t0', '166\\tCLINTON\\tHe said, back in 2006, \"Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\"\\t0', '167\\tCLINTON\\tWell, it did collapse.\\t0', \"168\\tTRUMP\\tThat's called business, by the way.\\t0\", '169\\tCLINTON\\tNine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.\\t0', '170\\tCLINTON\\tFive million people lost their homes.\\t0', '171\\tCLINTON\\tAnd $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.\\t0', '172\\tCLINTON\\tNow, we have come back from that abyss.\\t0', '173\\tCLINTON\\tAnd it has not been easy.\\t0', \"174\\tCLINTON\\tSo we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.\\t0\", \"175\\tCLINTON\\tIndependent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.\\t1\", \"176\\tCLINTON\\tThey've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.\\t1\", '177\\tCLINTON\\tTake clean energy.\\t0', '178\\tCLINTON\\tSome country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.\\t0', '179\\tCLINTON\\tDonald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.\\t1', \"180\\tCLINTON\\tI think it's real.\\t0\", '181\\tTRUMP\\tI did not.\\t0', '182\\tTRUMP\\tI did not.\\t0', '183\\tTRUMP\\tI do not say that.\\t0', '184\\tCLINTON\\tI think science is real.\\t0', '185\\tTRUMP\\tI do not say that.\\t0', \"186\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.\\t0\", \"187\\tCLINTON\\tAnd here's what we can do.\\t0\", '188\\tCLINTON\\tWe can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.\\t0', '189\\tCLINTON\\tWe can have enough clean energy to power every home.\\t0', '190\\tCLINTON\\tWe can build a new modern electric grid.\\t0', \"191\\tCLINTON\\tThat's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.\\t0\", \"192\\tCLINTON\\tSo I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.\\t0\", '193\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump?\\t0', '194\\tTRUMP\\tShe talks about solar panels.\\t0', '195\\tTRUMP\\tWe invested in a solar company, our country.\\t0', '196\\tTRUMP\\tThat was a disaster.\\t0', '197\\tTRUMP\\tThey lost plenty of money on that one.\\t0', \"198\\tTRUMP\\tNow, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.\\t0\", '199\\tTRUMP\\tOur energy policies are a disaster.\\t0', '200\\tTRUMP\\tOur country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.\\t0', \"201\\tTRUMP\\tYou can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.\\t0\", \"202\\tTRUMP\\tThe Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.\\t0\", \"203\\tTRUMP\\tHe's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.\\t0\", '204\\tTRUMP\\tSo I will tell you this.\\t0', '205\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.\\t0', \"206\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.\\t0\", \"207\\tTRUMP\\tAnd all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.\\t0\", \"208\\tTRUMP\\tAnd, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.\\t0\", \"209\\tTRUMP\\tYou've been doing this for 30 years.\\t0\", '210\\tTRUMP\\tWhy are you just thinking about these solutions right now?\\t0', \"211\\tTRUMP\\tFor 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.\\t0\", '212\\tCLINTON\\tWell, actually...\\t0', '213\\tTRUMP\\tI will bring -- excuse me.\\t0', '214\\tTRUMP\\tI will bring back jobs.\\t0', \"215\\tTRUMP\\tYou can't bring back jobs.\\t0\", '216\\tCLINTON\\tWell, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.\\t0', '217\\tTRUMP\\tYeah, for 30 years.\\t0', '218\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I have -- well, not quite that long.\\t0', '219\\tCLINTON\\tI think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.\\t0', '220\\tCLINTON\\tI think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...\\t0', '221\\tTRUMP\\tWell, he approved NAFTA...\\t1', '222\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '223\\tCLINTON\\tmillion new jobs, a balanced budget...\\t0', '224\\tTRUMP\\tHe approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\\t1', '225\\tCLINTON\\tIncomes went up for everybody.\\t0', \"226\\tCLINTON\\tManufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.\\t0\", '227\\tCLINTON\\tWhen I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.\\t0', '228\\tCLINTON\\tWill they create jobs in America?\\t0', '229\\tCLINTON\\tWill they raise incomes in America?\\t0', '230\\tCLINTON\\tAnd are they good for our national security?\\t0', '231\\tCLINTON\\tSome of them I voted for.\\t0', '232\\tCLINTON\\tThe biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.\\t0', '233\\tCLINTON\\tAnd because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.\\t0', \"234\\tCLINTON\\tBut let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.\\t0\", \"235\\tCLINTON\\tI think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.\\t0\", \"236\\tCLINTON\\tI'm going to have a special prosecutor.\\t0\", \"237\\tCLINTON\\tWe're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.\\t0\", '238\\tCLINTON\\tWhen I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.\\t0', '239\\tCLINTON\\tWe increased them to China 50 percent.\\t0', '240\\tCLINTON\\tSo I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.\\t0', '241\\tHOLT\\tVery quickly...\\t0', \"242\\tTRUMP\\tBut you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...\\t0\", \"243\\tCLINTON\\tWell, I've been a senator, Donald...\\t0\", \"244\\tTRUMP\\tYou haven't done it.\\t0\", \"245\\tTRUMP\\tYou haven't done it.\\t0\", '246\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I have been a secretary of state...\\t0', '247\\tTRUMP\\tExcuse me.\\t0', '248\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I have done a lot...\\t0', '249\\tTRUMP\\tYour husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.\\t1', \"250\\tCLINTON\\tWell, that's your opinion.\\t0\", '251\\tCLINTON\\tThat is your opinion.\\t0', '252\\tTRUMP\\tYou go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.\\t0', '253\\tTRUMP\\tNAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.\\t0', '254\\tTRUMP\\tAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\t0', '255\\tTRUMP\\tYou were totally in favor of it.\\t0', \"256\\tTRUMP\\tThen you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.\\t0\", '257\\tTRUMP\\tBut you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.\\t0', '258\\tTRUMP\\tNothing will ever top NAFTA.\\t0', '259\\tCLINTON\\tWell, that is just not accurate.\\t0', '260\\tCLINTON\\tI was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.\\t0', '261\\tCLINTON\\tI wrote about that in...\\t0', '262\\tTRUMP\\tYou called it the gold standard.\\t1', '263\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '264\\tTRUMP\\tYou called it the gold standard of

were against it.\\t0', '268\\tCLINTON\\tWell, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.\\t0', '269\\tCLINTON\\tThe facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal,

differences...\\t0', \"277\\tTRUMP\\tSecretary, is it President Obama's fault?\\t0\", '278\\tCLINTON\\tThere are...\\t0', \"279\\tTRUMP\\tBecause he's pushing it.\\t0\", \"280\\tCLINTON\\tThere are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.\\t0\", \"281\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.\\t0\", \"282\\tCLINTON\\tThat's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.\\t0\", '283\\tTRUMP\\tBut you have no

need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.\\t0\", '295\\tCLINTON\\tWe also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.\\t0', '296\\tCLINTON\\tSo we have a very robust set of plans.\\t0', '297\\tCLINTON\\tAnd people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and

create tremendous numbers of new jobs.\\t0', '305\\tTRUMP\\tBut regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.\\t0', \"306\\tTRUMP\\tWhen I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.\\t0\", \"307\\tTRUMP\\tAnd when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.\\t0\", '308\\tTRUMP\\tYou have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.\\t0', '309\\tTRUMP\\tAnd you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.\\t0', \"310\\tTRUMP\\tI'm going to cut regulations.\\t0\", \"311\\tTRUMP\\tI'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end

issue of achieving prosperity.\\t0\", '352\\tHOLT\\tAnd I want to talk about taxes.\\t0', '353\\tHOLT\\tThe fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.\\t0', \"354\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans.\\t0\", \"355\\tHOLT\\tI'd like you to further defend that.\\t0\", \"356\\tHOLT\\tAnd, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy.\\t0\", \"357\\tHOLT\\tI'd like you to defend that.\\t0\", '358\\tHOLT\\tAnd this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.\\t0', \"359\\tTRUMP\\tWell, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.\\t0\", \"360\\tTRUMP\\tThey're going to expand their companies.\\t0\", \"361\\tTRUMP\\tThey're going to do a tremendous job.\\t0\", \"362\\tTRUMP\\tI'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.\\t0\", \"363\\tTRUMP\\tAnd if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.\\t0\", \"364\\tTRUMP\\tIt's a great thing for the middle class.\\t0\", \"365\\tTRUMP\\tIt's a great thing for companies to expand.\\t0\", \"366\\tTRUMP\\tAnd when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.\\t0\", \"367\\tTRUMP\\tSo what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.\\t0\", \"368\\tTRUMP\\tAnd instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.\\t0\", \"369\\tTRUMP\\tInstead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.\\t0\", \"370\\tTRUMP\\tBecause we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.\\t0\", \"371\\tTRUMP\\tAnd here's the thing.\\t0\", '372\\tTRUMP\\tRepublicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.\\t0', \"373\\tTRUMP\\tI happen to think it's double that.\\t0\", \"374\\tTRUMP\\tIt's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.\\t0\", \"375\\tTRUMP\\tAnd with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.\\t0\", '376\\tTRUMP\\tBut we have no leadership.\\t0', '377\\tTRUMP\\tAnd honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.\\t0', '378\\tHOLT\\tAll right.\\t0', '379\\tHOLT\\tYou have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.\\t0', \"380\\tCLINTON\\tI have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.\\t0\", '381\\tTRUMP\\tWhy not?\\t0', '382\\tCLINTON\\tWhy not?\\t0', '383\\tCLINTON\\tYeah, why not?\\t0', '384\\tSYSTEM\\t(LAUGHTER)\\t0', '385\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.\\t0', '386\\tCLINTON\\tNow, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...\\t0', \"387\\tTRUMP\\tThere's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.\\t0\", \"388\\tHOLT\\tThis is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.\\t0\", '389\\tTRUMP\\tYes.\\t0', \"390\\tCLINTON\\tYeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.\\t0\", \"391\\tCLINTON\\tWe've looked at your tax proposals.\\t0\", \"392\\tCLINTON\\tI don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.\\t0\", '393\\tCLINTON\\tI happen to support that.\\t0', \"394\\tTRUMP\\tThen you didn't read it.\\t0\", '395\\tCLINTON\\tI happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.\\t0', '396\\tCLINTON\\tBut when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.\\t0', \"397\\tCLINTON\\tYou've proposed an approach that has a...\\t0\", '398\\tTRUMP\\tWho gave it that name?\\t0', \"399\\tTRUMP\\tThe first I've -- who gave it that name?\\t0\", '400\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', \"401\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.\\t0\", '402\\tCLINTON\\t$4 billion tax benefit for your family.\\t0', '403\\tCLINTON\\tAnd when you look at what you are proposing...\\t0', '404\\tTRUMP\\tHow much?\\t0', '405\\tTRUMP\\tHow much for my family?\\t0', '406\\tCLINTON\\tit is...\\t0', '407\\tTRUMP\\tLester, how much?\\t0', '408\\tCLINTON\\tas I said, trumped-up trickle-down.\\t0', '409\\tCLINTON\\tTrickle-down did not work.\\t0', '410\\tCLINTON\\tIt got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.\\t0', \"411\\tCLINTON\\tSlashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.\\t0\", '412\\tCLINTON\\tAnd a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.\\t0', '413\\tCLINTON\\tAnd they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.\\t0', \"414\\tCLINTON\\tI don't think top-down works in America.\\t0\", '415\\tCLINTON\\tI think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.\\t0', '416\\tCLINTON\\tThose are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.\\t0', '417\\tCLINTON\\tBroad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.\\t0', \"418\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump, we're...\\t0\", '419\\tTRUMP\\tTypical politician.\\t0', '420\\tTRUMP\\tAll talk, no action.\\t0', \"421\\tTRUMP\\tSounds good, doesn't work.\\t0\", '422\\tTRUMP\\tNever going to happen.\\t0', \"423\\tTRUMP\\tOur country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.\\t0\", '424\\tTRUMP\\tNow, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.\\t0', \"425\\tTRUMP\\tAnd believe me: We're in a bubble right now.\\t0\", \"426\\tTRUMP\\tAnd the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.\\t0\", '427\\tTRUMP\\tWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.\\t0', '428\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we better be awfully careful.\\t0', \"429\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we have a Fed that's doing political things.\\t0\", '430\\tTRUMP\\tThis Janet Yellen of the Fed.\\t0', '431\\tTRUMP\\tThe Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.\\t0', \"432\\tTRUMP\\tAnd believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.\\t0\", '433\\tTRUMP\\tThe Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.\\t0', \"434\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.\\t0\", '435\\tHOLT\\tAnd the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.\\t0', \"436\\tHOLT\\tDon't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?\\t0\", \"437\\tTRUMP\\tI don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.\\t0\", \"438\\tTRUMP\\tAnd it'll be released.\\t0\", \"439\\tTRUMP\\tAnd -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.\\t0\", '440\\tTRUMP\\tBut you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.\\t0', '441\\tTRUMP\\tIt shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.\\t0', '442\\tTRUMP\\tIf you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.\\t0', \"443\\tTRUMP\\tBut that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.\\t0\", \"444\\tTRUMP\\tWhen we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.\\t1\", '445\\tTRUMP\\tYou know what that is?\\t0', \"446\\tTRUMP\\tThat means, who's negotiating these trade deals?\\t0\", '447\\tTRUMP\\tWe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.\\t0', '448\\tHOLT\\tThe IRS says an audit...\\t0', '449\\tTRUMP\\tExcuse me.\\t0', \"450\\tHOLT\\tof your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit.\\t0\", \"451\\tHOLT\\tAnd so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...\\t0\", '452\\tTRUMP\\tWell, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.\\t0', \"453\\tTRUMP\\tLook, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.\\t0\", '454\\tTRUMP\\tI know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.\\t0', '455\\tTRUMP\\tI said, do you get audited?\\t0', '456\\tTRUMP\\tI get audited almost every year.\\t0', '457\\tTRUMP\\tAnd in a way, I should be complaining.\\t0', \"458\\tTRUMP\\tI'm not even complaining.\\t0\", \"459\\tTRUMP\\tI don't mind it.\\t0\", \"460\\tTRUMP\\tIt's almost become a way of life.\\t0\", '461\\tTRUMP\\tI get audited by the IRS.\\t0', \"462\\tTRUMP\\tBut other people don't.\\t0\", '463\\tTRUMP\\tI will say this.\\t0', '464\\tTRUMP\\tWe have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.\\t0', \"465\\tTRUMP\\tI will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.\\t0\", '466\\tTRUMP\\tAs soon as she releases them, I will release.\\t0', '467\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', '468\\tTRUMP\\tI will release my tax returns.\\t0', '469\\tTRUMP\\tAnd that\\'s against -- my lawyers, they say, \"Don\\'t do it.\"\\t0', '470\\tTRUMP\\tI will tell you this.\\t0', \"471\\tTRUMP\\tNo -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.\\t0\", \"472\\tTRUMP\\tAlmost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.\\t0\", \"473\\tTRUMP\\tWhen the audit's complete, I'll do it.\\t0\", '474\\tTRUMP\\tBut I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.\\t0', \"475\\tHOLT\\tSo it's negotiable?\\t0\", \"476\\tTRUMP\\tIt's not negotiable, no.\\t0\", '477\\tTRUMP\\tLet her release the e-mails.\\t0', '478\\tTRUMP\\tWhy did she delete 33,000...\\t0', \"479\\tHOLT\\tWell, I'll let her answer that.\\t0\", '480\\tHOLT\\tBut let me just admonish the audience one more time.\\t0', '481\\tHOLT\\tThere was an agreement.\\t0', '482\\tHOLT\\tWe did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.\\t0', '483\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton?\\t0', \"484\\tCLINTON\\tWell, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.\\t0\", '485\\tCLINTON\\tFor 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.\\t0', '486\\tCLINTON\\tYou can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.\\t0', \"487\\tCLINTON\\tWe know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.\\t0\", \"488\\tCLINTON\\tSo you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?\\t0\", '489\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think there may be a couple of reasons.\\t0', \"490\\tCLINTON\\tFirst, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.\\t0\", \"491\\tCLINTON\\tSecond, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.\\t0\", \"492\\tCLINTON\\tThird, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.\\t0\", \"493\\tCLINTON\\tOr maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.\\t1\", '494\\tTRUMP\\tThat makes me smart.\\t0', \"495\\tCLINTON\\tSo if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.\\t0\", \"496\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.\\t0\", \"497\\tCLINTON\\tAnd the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.\\t0\", \"498\\tCLINTON\\tThey don't give you all the details that tax returns would.\\t0\", '499\\tCLINTON\\tAnd it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.\\t0', \"500\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.\\t0\", \"501\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we'll guess.\\t0\", \"502\\tCLINTON\\tWe'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.\\t0\", '503\\tCLINTON\\tBut I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?\\t0', '504\\tCLINTON\\tWho does he owe money to?\\t0', '505\\tCLINTON\\tWell, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.\\t0', '506\\tHOLT\\tHe also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.\\t0', '507\\tHOLT\\tDo you want to respond to that?\\t0', '508\\tCLINTON\\tI do.\\t0', '509\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.\\t0', \"510\\tTRUMP\\tThat's for sure.\\t0\", '511\\tCLINTON\\tAnd if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.\\t0', \"512\\tCLINTON\\tBut I'm not going to make any excuses.\\t0\", '513\\tCLINTON\\tIt was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.\\t0', '514\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump?\\t0', '515\\tTRUMP\\tThat was more than a mistake.\\t0', '516\\tTRUMP\\tThat was done purposely.\\t0', '517\\tTRUMP\\tOK?\\t0', '518\\tTRUMP\\tThat was not a mistake.\\t0', '519\\tTRUMP\\tThat was done purposely.\\t0', \"520\\tTRUMP\\tWhen you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.\\t0\", \"521\\tTRUMP\\tAnd believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.\\t0\", \"522\\tTRUMP\\tAs far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.\\t1\", '523\\tTRUMP\\tThat I can tell you.\\t0', '524\\tTRUMP\\tYou learn a lot from financial disclosure.\\t0', '525\\tTRUMP\\tAnd you should go down and take a look at that.\\t0', \"526\\tTRUMP\\tThe other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.\\t0\", \"527\\tTRUMP\\tThe report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.\\t0\", \"528\\tTRUMP\\tIt's not a lot of money relative to what I had.\\t0\", \"529\\tTRUMP\\tThe buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.\\t0\", \"530\\tTRUMP\\tAnd the $650 isn't even on that.\\t0\", \"531\\tTRUMP\\tBut it's not $650.\\t0\", \"532\\tTRUMP\\tIt's much less than that.\\t0\", '533\\tTRUMP\\tBut I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.\\t0', '534\\tTRUMP\\tThese are very fine institutions, very fine banks.\\t0', '535\\tTRUMP\\tI could do that very quickly.\\t0', '536\\tTRUMP\\tI am very underleveraged.\\t0', '537\\tTRUMP\\tI have a great company.\\t0', '538\\tTRUMP\\tI have a tremendous income.\\t0', '539\\tTRUMP\\tAnd the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.\\t0', \"540\\tTRUMP\\tIt's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.\\t0\", \"541\\tTRUMP\\tWhen we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.\\t0\", '542\\tTRUMP\\tOur airports are like from a third world country.\\t0', \"543\\tTRUMP\\tYou land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.\\t0\", '544\\tTRUMP\\tSo the worst of all things has happened.\\t0', \"545\\tTRUMP\\tWe owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.\\t0\", \"546\\tTRUMP\\tWe haven't even started.\\t0\", \"547\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.\\t0\", \"548\\tTRUMP\\tWhether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.\\t0\", \"549\\tTRUMP\\tAnd it's really a shame.\\t0\", \"550\\tTRUMP\\tAnd it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.\\t0\", '551\\tTRUMP\\tOur country has tremendous problems.\\t0', \"552\\tTRUMP\\tWe're a debtor nation.\\t0\", \"553\\tTRUMP\\tWe're a serious debtor nation.\\t0\", '554\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.\\t0', \"555\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.\\t0\", \"556\\tHOLT\\tWe'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.\\t0\", \"557\\tCLINTON\\tAnd maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.\\t0\", '558\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', '559\\tCLINTON\\tAnd the other thing I think is important...\\t0', '560\\tTRUMP\\tIt would be squandered, too, believe me.\\t0', '561\\tCLINTON\\tis if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.\\t0', '562\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.\\t0', '563\\tCLINTON\\tAnd, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.\\t0', \"564\\tCLINTON\\tI've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.\\t0\", '565\\tCLINTON\\tWe have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.\\t0', \"566\\tCLINTON\\tIt's a beautiful facility.\\t0\", '567\\tCLINTON\\tIt immediately was put to use.\\t0', \"568\\tCLINTON\\tAnd you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...\\t0\", \"569\\tTRUMP\\tMaybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...\\t0\", '570\\tCLINTON\\tWell, to...\\t0', '571\\tTRUMP\\tWhich our country should do, too.\\t0', '572\\tCLINTON\\tDo the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?\\t0', \"573\\tCLINTON\\tI can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.\\t0\", '574\\tCLINTON\\tHe provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.\\t0', \"575\\tCLINTON\\tAnd when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.\\t1\", '576\\tCLINTON\\tThere are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.\\t0', '577\\tCLINTON\\tYou call yourself the King of Debt.\\t0', '578\\tCLINTON\\tYou talk about leverage.\\t0', '579\\tCLINTON\\tYou even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.\\t0', '580\\tTRUMP\\tWrong.\\t0', '581\\tTRUMP\\tWrong.\\t0', \"582\\tCLINTON\\tWell, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.\\t0\", \"583\\tHOLT\\tLet's let Mr. Trump...\\t0\", '584\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we need to be very clear about that.\\t0', \"585\\tTRUMP\\tSo, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.\\t0\", \"586\\tTRUMP\\tLook, it's all words, it's all sound bites.\\t0\", '587\\tTRUMP\\tI built an unbelievable company.\\t0', '588\\tTRUMP\\tSome of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.\\t0', \"589\\tTRUMP\\tIt's an unbelievable company.\\t0\", '590\\tTRUMP\\tBut on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.\\t1', \"591\\tTRUMP\\tAnd when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.\\t0\", \"592\\tTRUMP\\tNow, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.\\t0\", \"593\\tTRUMP\\tBut I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.\\t0\", '594\\tTRUMP\\tMy obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.\\t0', \"595\\tTRUMP\\tAnd that's what I do.\\t0\", \"596\\tTRUMP\\tBut what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.\\t0\", \"597\\tTRUMP\\tI'll give you an example.\\t0\", \"598\\tTRUMP\\tWe're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.\\t0\", \"599\\tTRUMP\\tBut we're opening the Old Post Office.\\t0\", '600\\tTRUMP\\tUnder budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.\\t0', \"601\\tTRUMP\\tI'm a year ahead of schedule.\\t0\", \"602\\tTRUMP\\tAnd that's what this country should be doing.\\t0\", \"603\\tTRUMP\\tWe build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.\\t0\", \"604\\tTRUMP\\tWe buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.\\t0\", '605\\tTRUMP\\tWhen we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.\\t0', '606\\tTRUMP\\tThe Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.\\t0', '607\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we should be able to do that for our country.\\t0', \"608\\tHOLT\\tWell, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment.\\t0\", \"609\\tHOLT\\tWe move into our next segment talking about America's direction.\\t0\", \"610\\tHOLT\\tAnd let's start by talking about race.\\t0\", \"611\\tHOLT\\tThe share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.\\t0\", '612\\tHOLT\\tRace has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.\\t0', '613\\tHOLT\\tSo how do you heal the divide?\\t0', '614\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.\\t0', \"615\\tCLINTON\\tWell, you're right.\\t0\", '616\\tCLINTON\\tRace remains a significant challenge in our country.\\t0', \"617\\tCLINTON\\tUnfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.\\t0\", \"618\\tCLINTON\\tWe've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.\\t0\", \"619\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we've got to do several things at the same time.\\t0\", '620\\tCLINTON\\tWe have to restore trust between communities and the police.\\t0', \"621\\tCLINTON\\tWe have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.\\t0\", '622\\tCLINTON\\tEveryone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.\\t0', \"623\\tCLINTON\\tRight now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.\\t0\", '624\\tCLINTON\\tSo I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.\\t0', \"625\\tCLINTON\\tI've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.\\t0\", '626\\tCLINTON\\tBut we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.\\t0', '627\\tCLINTON\\tSo we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.\\t0', \"628\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.\\t0\", '629\\tCLINTON\\tThe gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.\\t0', '630\\tCLINTON\\tSo we have to do two things, as I said.\\t0', '631\\tCLINTON\\tWe have to restore trust.\\t0', '632\\tCLINTON\\tWe have to work with the police.\\t0', '633\\tCLINTON\\tWe have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.\\t0', \"634\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.\\t0\", '635\\tHOLT\\tAll right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\\t0', '636\\tHOLT\\tHow do you heal the divide?\\t0', \"637\\tTRUMP\\tWell, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.\\t0\", '638\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we need law and order.\\t0', \"639\\tTRUMP\\tIf we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.\\t0\", \"640\\tTRUMP\\tAnd when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.\\t0\", '641\\tTRUMP\\tI just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.\\t0', '642\\tTRUMP\\tWe have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.\\t0', \"643\\tTRUMP\\tWe have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.\\t0\", '644\\tTRUMP\\tYou walk down the street, you get shot.\\t0', \"645\\tTRUMP\\tIn Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.\\t0\", '646\\tTRUMP\\tThousands of shootings.\\t0', \"647\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I'm saying, where is this?\\t0\", '648\\tTRUMP\\tIs this a war-torn country?\\t0', '649\\tTRUMP\\tWhat are we doing?\\t0', '650\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we have to stop the violence.\\t0', '651\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to bring back law and order.\\t0', '652\\tTRUMP\\tIn a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.\\t1', '653\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to bring back law and order.\\t0', '654\\tTRUMP\\tNow, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.\\t0', '655\\tTRUMP\\tIt brought the crime rate way down.\\t0', \"656\\tTRUMP\\tBut you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.\\t0\", '657\\tTRUMP\\tWe have gangs roaming the street.\\t0', \"658\\tTRUMP\\tAnd in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.\\t0\", '659\\tTRUMP\\tAnd they have guns.\\t0', '660\\tTRUMP\\tAnd they shoot people.\\t0', '661\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we have to be very strong.\\t0', '662\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we have to be very vigilant.\\t0', \"663\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.\\t0\", '664\\tTRUMP\\tRight now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.\\t0', '665\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.\\t0', '666\\tHOLT\\tYour two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up.\\t0', '667\\tHOLT\\tStop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.\\t1', \"668\\tTRUMP\\tNo, you're wrong.\\t0\", '669\\tTRUMP\\tIt went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.\\t0', '670\\tTRUMP\\tIt was taken away from her.\\t0', '671\\tTRUMP\\tAnd our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.\\t0', '672\\tTRUMP\\tThey would have won an appeal.\\t0', \"673\\tTRUMP\\tIf you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.\\t0\", \"674\\tHOLT\\tThe argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.\\t0\", \"675\\tTRUMP\\tNo, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.\\t0\", '676\\tTRUMP\\tThese are felons.\\t0', \"677\\tTRUMP\\tThese are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.\\t0\", '678\\tTRUMP\\tYou need more police.\\t0', '679\\tTRUMP\\tYou need a better community, you know, relation.\\t0', \"680\\tTRUMP\\tYou don't have good community relations in Chicago.\\t0\", \"681\\tTRUMP\\tIt's terrible.\\t0\", '682\\tTRUMP\\tI have property there.\\t0', \"683\\tTRUMP\\tIt's terrible what's going on in Chicago.\\t0\", \"684\\tTRUMP\\tBut when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.\\t0\", '685\\tTRUMP\\tYou need better relationships.\\t0', '686\\tTRUMP\\tI agree with Secretary Clinton on this.\\t0', \"687\\tTRUMP\\tYou need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.\\t0\", '688\\tTRUMP\\tBut you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.\\t0', \"689\\tTRUMP\\tSo there's some bad things going on.\\t0\", '690\\tTRUMP\\tSome really bad things.\\t0', '691\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton...\\t0', '692\\tTRUMP\\tBut we need -- Lester, we need law and order.\\t0', \"693\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.\\t0\", \"694\\tTRUMP\\tAnd it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\\t0\", '695\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton?\\t0', \"696\\tCLINTON\\tWell, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.\\t0\", '697\\tTRUMP\\tUgh.\\t0', '698\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.\\t0', \"699\\tCLINTON\\tThere's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.\\t0\", '700\\tCLINTON\\tBut we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.\\t0', '701\\tCLINTON\\tThere are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.\\t0', '702\\tCLINTON\\tStop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.\\t1', '703\\tCLINTON\\tIt did not do what it needed to do.\\t0', '704\\tCLINTON\\tNow, I believe in community policing.\\t0', '705\\tCLINTON\\tAnd, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.\\t0', '706\\tCLINTON\\tProperty crime is down 40 percent.\\t0', \"707\\tCLINTON\\tWe just don't want to see it creep back up.\\t0\", \"708\\tCLINTON\\tWe've had 25 years of very good cooperation.\\t0\", '709\\tCLINTON\\tBut there were some problems, some unintended consequences.\\t0', '710\\tCLINTON\\tToo many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.\\t0', \"711\\tCLINTON\\tAnd it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.\\t0\", \"712\\tCLINTON\\tSo we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.\\t0\", '713\\tCLINTON\\tWe cannot just say law and order.\\t0', '714\\tCLINTON\\tWe have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.\\t0', '715\\tCLINTON\\tWe need to have more second chance programs.\\t0', \"716\\tCLINTON\\tI'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.\\t0\", \"717\\tCLINTON\\tYou shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.\\t0\", '718\\tCLINTON\\tSo there are some positive ways we can work on this.\\t0', '719\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.\\t0', \"720\\tCLINTON\\tRight now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.\\t0\", '721\\tCLINTON\\tIn a lot of places, our police are outgunned.\\t0', '722\\tCLINTON\\tWe need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.\\t0', \"723\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.\\t0\", \"724\\tCLINTON\\tIf you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.\\t0\", '725\\tCLINTON\\tSo there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.\\t0', \"726\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.\\t0\", '727\\tHOLT\\tDo you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?\\t0', '728\\tCLINTON\\tLester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.\\t0', '729\\tCLINTON\\tI think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.\\t0', '730\\tCLINTON\\tAnd therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?\\t0', '731\\tCLINTON\\tBut when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.\\t0', \"732\\tCLINTON\\tI've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.\\t0\", \"733\\tCLINTON\\tThey admit it's an issue.\\t0\", \"734\\tCLINTON\\tThey've got a lot of concerns.\\t0\", '735\\tCLINTON\\tMental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.\\t0', '736\\tCLINTON\\tThey want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.\\t0', '737\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.\\t0', '738\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump...\\t0', \"739\\tTRUMP\\tI'd like to respond to that.\\t0\", '740\\tHOLT\\tPlease.\\t0', '741\\tTRUMP\\tFirst of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.\\t0', '742\\tTRUMP\\tI agree with you.\\t0', \"743\\tTRUMP\\tWhen a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.\\t0\", \"744\\tTRUMP\\tThese are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.\\t0\", '745\\tTRUMP\\tBut I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.\\t0', \"746\\tTRUMP\\tAnd when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.\\t0\", '747\\tTRUMP\\tBut I tend to agree with that quite strongly.\\t0', '748\\tTRUMP\\tI do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.\\t0', \"749\\tTRUMP\\tAnd that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.\\t0\", \"750\\tTRUMP\\tI think you've apologized for it.\\t0\", '751\\tTRUMP\\tBut I think it was a terrible thing to say.\\t0', \"752\\tTRUMP\\tAnd when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.\\t0\", \"753\\tTRUMP\\tWell, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.\\t0\", \"754\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.\\t0\", \"755\\tTRUMP\\tI think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.\\t0\", '756\\tTRUMP\\tFive hundred murders is a lot of murders.\\t0', \"757\\tTRUMP\\tIt's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?\\t0\", '758\\tTRUMP\\tBut we went from 2,200 to 500.\\t0', '759\\tTRUMP\\tAnd it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.\\t0', '760\\tTRUMP\\tAnd it was terminated by current mayor.\\t0', '761\\tTRUMP\\tBut stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.\\t0', '762\\tTRUMP\\tTremendous beyond belief.\\t0', '763\\tTRUMP\\tSo when you say it has no impact, it really did.\\t0', '764\\tTRUMP\\tIt had a very, very big impact.\\t0', \"765\\tCLINTON\\tWell, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.\\t1\", '766\\tCLINTON\\tSo there is...\\t0', \"767\\tTRUMP\\tNo, you're wrong.\\t0\", \"768\\tTRUMP\\tYou're wrong.\\t0\", \"769\\tCLINTON\\tNo, I'm not.\\t0\", '770\\tTRUMP\\tMurders are up.\\t1', '771\\tTRUMP\\tAll right.\\t0', '772\\tTRUMP\\tYou check it.\\t0', '773\\tCLINTON\\tNew York -- New York has done an excellent job.\\t0', '774\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.\\t0', '775\\tCLINTON\\tAnd other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.\\t0', '776\\tCLINTON\\tLook, one murder is too many.\\t0', '777\\tCLINTON\\tBut it is important that we learn about what has been effective.\\t0', '778\\tCLINTON\\tAnd not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.\\t0', '779\\tCLINTON\\tWho disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?\\t0', \"780\\tCLINTON\\tBut let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.\\t0\", '781\\tCLINTON\\tAnd so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.\\t0', '782\\tHOLT\\tThis conversation is about race.\\t0', '783\\tHOLT\\tAnd so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...\\t0', \"784\\tTRUMP\\tI'd like to just respond, if I might.\\t0\", '785\\tHOLT\\tPlease -- 20 seconds.\\t0', \"786\\tTRUMP\\tI'd just like to respond.\\t0\", \"787\\tHOLT\\tPlease respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.\\t0\", '788\\tTRUMP\\tI will.\\t0', '789\\tTRUMP\\tLook, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.\\t0', \"790\\tTRUMP\\tThey talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.\\t0\", '791\\tTRUMP\\tThe African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.\\t0', \"792\\tTRUMP\\tThey've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.\\t0\", \"793\\tTRUMP\\tThey've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.\\t0\", '794\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump, let me...\\t0', '795\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '796\\tCLINTON\\tWell, I -- I do think...\\t0', \"797\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.\\t0\", \"798\\tTRUMP\\tYou decided to stay home, and that's OK.\\t0\", \"799\\tTRUMP\\tBut I will tell you, I've been all over.\\t0\", \"800\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.\\t0\", '801\\tTRUMP\\tAnd they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.\\t0', '802\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump, I...\\t0', '803\\tCLINTON\\tI think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.\\t0', '804\\tCLINTON\\tAnd, yes, I did.\\t0', '805\\tCLINTON\\tAnd you know what else I prepared for?\\t0', '806\\tCLINTON\\tI prepared to be president.\\t0', \"807\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think that's a good thing.\\t0\", '808\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', \"809\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen.\\t0\", '810\\tHOLT\\tYou questioned his legitimacy.\\t0', '811\\tHOLT\\tIn the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States.\\t0', '812\\tHOLT\\tCan you tell us what took you so long?\\t0', \"813\\tTRUMP\\tI'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.\\t0\", '814\\tTRUMP\\tSidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.\\t0', '815\\tTRUMP\\tAnd her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.\\t0', '816\\tTRUMP\\tAnd you can go look it up, and you can check it out.\\t0', '817\\tTRUMP\\tAnd if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.\\t1', '818\\tTRUMP\\tBlumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.\\t1', '819\\tTRUMP\\tThey were pressing it very hard.\\t0', '820\\tTRUMP\\tShe failed to get the birth certificate.\\t0', \"821\\tTRUMP\\tWhen I got involved, I didn't fail.\\t0\", '822\\tTRUMP\\tI got him to give the birth certificate.\\t0', \"823\\tTRUMP\\tSo I'm satisfied with it.\\t0\", \"824\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.\\t0\", '825\\tHOLT\\tThat was...\\t0', '826\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '827\\tTRUMP\\tBecause I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.\\t0', '828\\tHOLT\\tI will let you respond.\\t0', \"829\\tHOLT\\tIt's important.\\t0\", '830\\tHOLT\\tBut I just want to get the answer here.\\t0', '831\\tHOLT\\tThe birth certificate was produced in 2011.\\t0', \"832\\tHOLT\\tYou've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...\\t0\", '833\\tTRUMP\\tYeah.\\t0', '834\\tHOLT\\tas recently as January.\\t0', '835\\tHOLT\\tSo the question is, what changed your mind?\\t0', '836\\tTRUMP\\tWell, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.\\t0', \"837\\tTRUMP\\tI figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.\\t0\", '838\\tTRUMP\\tBut nobody was caring much about it.\\t0', '839\\tTRUMP\\tBut I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.\\t0', '840\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I think I did a good job.\\t0', '841\\tTRUMP\\tSecretary Clinton also fought it.\\t0', \"842\\tTRUMP\\tI mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.\\t0\", \"843\\tTRUMP\\tLook, it's true.\\t0\", '844\\tTRUMP\\tSidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.\\t1', '845\\tTRUMP\\tAnd she was involved.\\t0', \"846\\tTRUMP\\tBut just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.\\t0\", \"847\\tHOLT\\tI'm sorry.\\t0\", \"848\\tHOLT\\tI'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there.\\t0\", \"849\\tHOLT\\tBut we're talking about racial healing in this segment.\\t0\", '850\\tHOLT\\tWhat do you say to Americans, people of color who...\\t0', '851\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '852\\tTRUMP\\tWell, it was very -- I say nothing.\\t0', '853\\tTRUMP\\tI say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.\\t0', '854\\tTRUMP\\tHe should have produced it a long time before.\\t0', '855\\tTRUMP\\tI say nothing.\\t0', '856\\tTRUMP\\tBut let me just tell you.\\t0', \"857\\tTRUMP\\tWhen you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.\\t0\", '858\\tTRUMP\\tI think you can see that.\\t0', '859\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.\\t0', '860\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.\\t0', '861\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton?\\t0', '862\\tCLINTON\\tWell, just listen to what you heard.\\t0', '863\\tSYSTEM\\t(LAUGHTER)\\t0', '864\\tCLINTON\\tAnd clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.\\t0', \"865\\tCLINTON\\tBut it can't be dismissed that easily.\\t0\", '866\\tCLINTON\\tHe has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.\\t0', '867\\tCLINTON\\tThere was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.\\t0', '868\\tCLINTON\\tBut, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.\\t0', '869\\tCLINTON\\tHe actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.\\t0', '870\\tCLINTON\\tSo he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.\\t0', '871\\tCLINTON\\tAnd the birther lie was a very hurtful one.\\t0', '872\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.\\t0', '873\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.\\t0', '874\\tCLINTON\\tBut I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.\\t0', \"875\\tCLINTON\\tAnd Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.\\t0\", \"876\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.\\t0\", '877\\tTRUMP\\tI would love to respond.\\t0', '878\\tTRUMP\\tFirst of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.\\t0', '879\\tTRUMP\\tYou treated him with terrible disrespect.\\t0', '880\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.\\t0', \"881\\tTRUMP\\tIt doesn't work that way.\\t0\", '882\\tTRUMP\\tYou were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.\\t0', \"883\\tTRUMP\\tI don't think you can deny that.\\t0\", '884\\tTRUMP\\tBut just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.\\t0', \"885\\tTRUMP\\tSo when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.\\t0\", \"886\\tTRUMP\\tIt really doesn't.\\t0\", \"887\\tTRUMP\\tNow, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.\\t0\", '888\\tTRUMP\\tWe settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.\\t0', '889\\tTRUMP\\tIt was very easy to do.\\t0', '890\\tTRUMP\\tI notice you bring that up a lot.\\t0', \"891\\tTRUMP\\tAnd, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.\\t0\", \"892\\tTRUMP\\tMaybe I'm trying to save the money.\\t0\", \"893\\tTRUMP\\tBut, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?\\t0\", \"894\\tTRUMP\\tBecause I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.\\t0\", \"895\\tTRUMP\\tI'll go one step further.\\t0\", '896\\tTRUMP\\tIn Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.\\t0', '897\\tTRUMP\\tNo discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.\\t0', \"898\\tTRUMP\\tAnd it's a tremendously successful club.\\t0\", \"899\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I'm so glad I did it.\\t0\", '900\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I have been given great credit for what I did.\\t0', \"901\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I'm very, very proud of it.\\t0\", \"902\\tTRUMP\\tAnd that's the way I feel.\\t0\", '903\\tTRUMP\\tThat is the true way I feel.\\t0', '904\\tHOLT\\tOur next segment is called \"Securing America.\"\\t0', '905\\tHOLT\\tWe want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.\\t0', '906\\tHOLT\\tOur institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen.\\t0', \"907\\tHOLT\\tSo my question is, who's behind it?\\t0\", '908\\tHOLT\\tAnd how do we fight it?\\t0', '909\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.\\t0', \"910\\tCLINTON\\tWell, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.\\t0\", '911\\tCLINTON\\tThere are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.\\t0', '912\\tCLINTON\\tBut increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.\\t0', '913\\tCLINTON\\tThe most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.\\t0', \"914\\tCLINTON\\tThere's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.\\t0\", \"915\\tCLINTON\\tI know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...\\t0\", '916\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '917\\tCLINTON\\ttough, long game here.\\t0', \"918\\tCLINTON\\tAnd one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.\\t0\", '919\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.\\t0', \"920\\tCLINTON\\tWe need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.\\t0\", '921\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.\\t0', \"922\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.\\t0\", \"923\\tCLINTON\\tWe don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.\\t0\", '924\\tCLINTON\\tBut we will defend the citizens of this country.\\t0', '925\\tCLINTON\\tAnd the Russians need to understand that.\\t0', \"926\\tCLINTON\\tI think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.\\t0\", \"927\\tCLINTON\\tAnd that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.\\t0\", '928\\tCLINTON\\tThat is just unacceptable.\\t0', \"929\\tCLINTON\\tIt's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...\\t0\", '930\\tHOLT\\tYour two minutes have expired.\\t0', '931\\tCLINTON\\thave said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.\\t0', \"932\\tCLINTON\\tIt's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.\\t0\", '933\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question.\\t0', \"934\\tHOLT\\tWho's behind it?\\t0\", '935\\tHOLT\\tAnd how do we fight it?\\t0', '936\\tTRUMP\\tI do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.\\t0', '937\\tTRUMP\\tThat just happened, and many more are coming.\\t0', \"938\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I'm very proud of it.\\t0\", '939\\tTRUMP\\tIn addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.\\t0', \"940\\tTRUMP\\tThey've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.\\t0\", '941\\tTRUMP\\tI was just endorsed by ICE.\\t0', '942\\tTRUMP\\tI was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.\\t0', \"943\\tTRUMP\\tSo when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.\\t0\", '944\\tTRUMP\\tOK?\\t0', \"945\\tTRUMP\\tBecause look at the mess that we're in.\\t0\", \"946\\tTRUMP\\tLook at the mess that we're in.\\t0\", '947\\tTRUMP\\tAs far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.\\t0', \"948\\tTRUMP\\tWe should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.\\t0\", \"949\\tTRUMP\\tI don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.\\t0\", \"950\\tTRUMP\\tShe's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.\\t0\", '951\\tTRUMP\\tI mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.\\t0', '952\\tTRUMP\\tIt could also be lots of other people.\\t0', '953\\tTRUMP\\tIt also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?\\t0', \"954\\tTRUMP\\tYou don't know who broke in to DNC.\\t0\", '955\\tTRUMP\\tBut what did we learn with DNC?\\t0', '956\\tTRUMP\\tWe learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\\t0', '957\\tTRUMP\\tLook what happened to her.\\t0', '958\\tTRUMP\\tBut Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.\\t0', \"959\\tTRUMP\\tThat's what we learned.\\t0\", \"960\\tTRUMP\\tNow, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.\\t0\", \"961\\tTRUMP\\tWe came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.\\t0\", '962\\tTRUMP\\tISIS.\\t0', '963\\tTRUMP\\tSo we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.\\t0', '964\\tTRUMP\\tIt is -- it is a huge problem.\\t0', '965\\tTRUMP\\tI have a son.\\t0', \"966\\tTRUMP\\tHe's 10 years old.\\t0\", '967\\tTRUMP\\tHe has computers.\\t0', \"968\\tTRUMP\\tHe is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.\\t0\", '969\\tTRUMP\\tThe security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.\\t0', \"970\\tTRUMP\\tAnd maybe it's hardly doable.\\t0\", '971\\tTRUMP\\tBut I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.\\t0', \"972\\tTRUMP\\tBut that's true throughout our whole governmental society.\\t0\", '973\\tTRUMP\\tWe have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.\\t0', '974\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton?\\t0', '975\\tCLINTON\\tWell, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.\\t0', '976\\tCLINTON\\tI have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.\\t0', '977\\tCLINTON\\tIt does involve going after them online.\\t0', '978\\tCLINTON\\tI think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.\\t0', '979\\tCLINTON\\tBut we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.\\t0', \"980\\tCLINTON\\tWe're making progress.\\t0\", '981\\tCLINTON\\tOur military is assisting in Iraq.\\t0', \"982\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.\\t0\", \"983\\tCLINTON\\tBut we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.\\t0\", '984\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.\\t0', '985\\tCLINTON\\tI was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.\\t0', '986\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.\\t0', \"987\\tCLINTON\\tBecause we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.\\t0\", '988\\tHOLT\\tYou mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.\\t0', \"989\\tHOLT\\tI'll ask this to both of you.\\t0\", '990\\tHOLT\\tTell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?\\t0', '991\\tTRUMP\\tWell, first I have to say one thing, very important.\\t0', '992\\tTRUMP\\tSecretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.\\t0', '993\\tTRUMP\\tWe will take out ISIS.\\t0', \"994\\tTRUMP\\tWell, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.\\t0\", '995\\tTRUMP\\tAnd ISIS was formed.\\t0', '996\\tTRUMP\\tSo she talks about taking them out.\\t0', \"997\\tTRUMP\\tShe's been doing it a long time.\\t0\", \"998\\tTRUMP\\tShe's been trying to take them out for a long time.\\t0\", \"999\\tTRUMP\\tBut they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.\\t0\", \"1000\\tTRUMP\\tAnd then you wouldn't have had them.\\t0\", \"1001\\tTRUMP\\tOr, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.\\t0\", '1002\\tTRUMP\\tAnd now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.\\t1', '1003\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton?\\t0', '1004\\tCLINTON\\tWell, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.\\t0', '1005\\tCLINTON\\tDonald supported the invasion of Iraq.\\t0', '1006\\tTRUMP\\tWrong.\\t0', '1007\\tCLINTON\\tThat is absolutely proved over and over again.\\t0', '1008\\tTRUMP\\tWrong.\\t0', '1009\\tTRUMP\\tWrong.\\t0', '1010\\tCLINTON\\tHe actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.\\t0', '1011\\tCLINTON\\tBut the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.\\t0', '1012\\tCLINTON\\tAnd the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.\\t0', \"1013\\tCLINTON\\tBut let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.\\t0\", '1014\\tCLINTON\\tThe question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?\\t0', \"1015\\tCLINTON\\tThat's the most important part of this.\\t0\", '1016\\tCLINTON\\tHow do we prevent attacks?\\t0', '1017\\tCLINTON\\tHow do we protect our people?\\t0', \"1018\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.\\t0\", '1019\\tCLINTON\\tI was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.\\t0', '1020\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.\\t0', '1021\\tCLINTON\\tAnd they brought him down.\\t0', '1022\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.\\t0', \"1023\\tCLINTON\\tSo we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.\\t0\", \"1024\\tCLINTON\\tThat means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.\\t0\", \"1025\\tCLINTON\\tWe're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.\\t0\", \"1026\\tCLINTON\\tWe're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.\\t0\", '1027\\tCLINTON\\tDonald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.\\t0', \"1028\\tCLINTON\\tThey're on the front lines.\\t0\", '1029\\tCLINTON\\tThey can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.\\t0', \"1030\\tCLINTON\\tThey need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.\\t0\", '1031\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump...\\t0', '1032\\tTRUMP\\tWell, I have to respond.\\t0', '1033\\tHOLT\\tPlease respond.\\t0', \"1034\\tTRUMP\\tThe secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.\\t0\", \"1035\\tTRUMP\\tYou look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.\\t0\", '1036\\tTRUMP\\tUnder your direction, to a large extent.\\t0', \"1037\\tTRUMP\\tBut you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.\\t0\", '1038\\tTRUMP\\tThey were choking on the sanctions.\\t0', \"1039\\tTRUMP\\tAnd now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.\\t0\", '1040\\tTRUMP\\tBut when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?\\t0', \"1041\\tTRUMP\\tAnd you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.\\t0\", '1042\\tTRUMP\\tI did really well.\\t0', '1043\\tTRUMP\\tBut I have common sense.\\t0', \"1044\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I said, well, I'll tell you.\\t0\", \"1045\\tTRUMP\\tI haven't given lots of thought to NATO.\\t0\", '1046\\tTRUMP\\tBut two things.\\t0', \"1047\\tTRUMP\\tNumber one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.\\t0\", \"1048\\tTRUMP\\tNumber two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.\\t0\", '1049\\tTRUMP\\tAnd, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.\\t0', '1050\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I was very strong.\\t0', '1051\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I said it numerous times.\\t0', '1052\\tTRUMP\\tAnd about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.\\t0', \"1053\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I think that's great.\\t0\", '1054\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.\\t0', \"1055\\tTRUMP\\tIt's a lot of money to protect other people.\\t0\", \"1056\\tTRUMP\\tBut I'm all for NATO.\\t0\", '1057\\tTRUMP\\tBut I said they have to focus on terror, also.\\t0', \"1058\\tTRUMP\\tAnd they're going to do that.\\t0\", \"1059\\tTRUMP\\tAnd that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.\\t0\", '1060\\tTRUMP\\tI think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we

\"1091\\tTRUMP\\tThe record shows that I'm right.\\t0\", \"1092\\tTRUMP\\tWhen I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?\\t0\", '1093\\tTRUMP\\tEssentially.\\t0', '1094\\tTRUMP\\tI then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.\\t0', '1095\\tTRUMP\\tWe talked about the economy is more important.\\t0', '1096\\tTRUMP\\tI then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.\\t0', '1097\\tTRUMP\\tI had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.\\t0', '1098\\tTRUMP\\tAnd Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.\\t1', '1099\\tHOLT\\tWhy is your judgment better than...\\t0', '1100\\tTRUMP\\tAnd when he -- excuse me.\\t0', '1101\\tTRUMP\\tAnd that was before the war started.\\t0', \"1102\\tTRUMP\\tSean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's

'1137\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.\\t0', \"1138\\tCLINTON\\tAnd you know the only time it's ever been invoked?\\t0\", '1139\\tCLINTON\\tAfter 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.\\t0', '1140\\tCLINTON\\tWith respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.\\t0', '1141\\tCLINTON\\tThey had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.\\t0', '1142\\tCLINTON\\tThey had built covert facilities.\\t0', '1143\\tCLINTON\\tThey had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.\\t0', '1144\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we had sanctioned them.\\t0', \"1145\\tCLINTON\\tI voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.\\t0\", '1146\\tCLINTON\\tSo I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.\\t0', '1147\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we did drive them to the negotiating table.\\t0', \"1148\\tCLINTON\\tAnd my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.\\t0\", \"1149\\tCLINTON\\tThat's diplomacy.\\t0\", \"1150\\tCLINTON\\tThat's coalition-building.\\t0\", \"1151\\tCLINTON\\tThat's working with other nations.\\t0\", '1152\\tCLINTON\\tThe other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.\\t0', \"1153\\tCLINTON\\tHe said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.\\t0\", \"1154\\tCLINTON\\tThat's not good judgment.\\t0\", '1155\\tTRUMP\\tThat would not start a war.\\t0', '1156\\tCLINTON\\tThat is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.\\t0', '1157\\tCLINTON\\tAnd the worst part...\\t0', '1158\\tTRUMP\\tNo, they were taunting us.\\t0', '1159\\tCLINTON\\tof what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.\\t0', \"1160\\tCLINTON\\tHe has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.\\t0\", '1161\\tCLINTON\\tIt has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\\t0', \"1162\\tCLINTON\\tHe even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...\\t0\", '1163\\tTRUMP\\tWrong.\\t0', '1164\\tCLINTON\\thave a good time, folks.\\t0', \"1165\\tTRUMP\\tIt's lies.\\t0\", '1166\\tCLINTON\\tAnd, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.\\t0', '1167\\tCLINTON\\tThat is the number-one threat we face in the world.\\t0', '1168\\tCLINTON\\tAnd it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.\\t0', '1169\\tCLINTON\\tSo a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.\\t0', \"1170\\tTRUMP\\tThat line's getting a little bit old, I must say.\\t0\", '1171\\tTRUMP\\tI would like to...\\t0', \"1172\\tCLINTON\\tIt's a good one, though.\\t0\", '1173\\tCLINTON\\tIt well describes the problem.\\t0',

and just to respond.\\t0', '1178\\tTRUMP\\tI agree with her on one thing.\\t0', '1179\\tTRUMP\\tThe single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.\\t0', '1180\\tTRUMP\\tNuclear is the single greatest threat.\\t0', '1181\\tTRUMP\\tJust to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.\\t0', '1182\\tTRUMP\\tThey do not pay us.\\t0', \"1183\\tTRUMP\\tBut they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.\\t0\", \"1184\\tTRUMP\\tThat's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.\\t0\", '1185\\tTRUMP\\tI say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.\\t0', \"1186\\tTRUMP\\tAll I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.\\t0\", \"1187\\tTRUMP\\tWe can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...\\t0\", '1188\\tHOLT\\tWe need to move on.\\t0', \"1189\\tTRUMP\\tWell, wait, but it's very important.\\t0\", '1190\\tTRUMP\\tAll I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.\\t0', \"1191\\tTRUMP\\tWe're a country that owes $20 trillion.\\t0\", '1192\\tTRUMP\\tThey have to help us out.\\t0', '1193\\tHOLT\\tOur last...\\t0', '1194\\tTRUMP\\tAs far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.\\t0', '1195\\tTRUMP\\tIt is the single greatest threat that this country has.\\t0', '1196\\tHOLT\\tWhich leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America.\\t0', \"1197\\tHOLT\\tOn nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use.\\t0\", '1198\\tHOLT\\tDo you support the current policy?\\t0', '1199\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.\\t0', \"1200\\tTRUMP\\tWell, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.\\t0\", '1201\\tTRUMP\\tBut Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.\\t0', '1202\\tTRUMP\\tWe have not been updating from the new standpoint.\\t0', '1203\\tTRUMP\\tI looked the other night.\\t0', \"1204\\tTRUMP\\tI was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.\\t0\", '1205\\tTRUMP\\tWe are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.\\t0', '1206\\tTRUMP\\tI would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.\\t0', '1207\\tTRUMP\\tBut I would certainly not do first strike.\\t0', \"1208\\tTRUMP\\tI think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.\\t0\", '1209\\tTRUMP\\tAt the same time, we have to be prepared.\\t0', \"1210\\tTRUMP\\tI can't take anything off the table.\\t0\", \"1211\\tTRUMP\\tBecause you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.\\t0\", '1212\\tTRUMP\\tChina should solve that problem for us.\\t0', '1213\\tTRUMP\\tChina should go into North Korea.\\t0', '1214\\tTRUMP\\tChina is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.\\t0', \"1215\\tTRUMP\\tAnd by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.\\t0\", '1216\\tTRUMP\\tIran is one of their biggest trading partners.\\t0', '1217\\tTRUMP\\tIran has power over North Korea.\\t0', '1218\\tTRUMP\\tAnd when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.\\t0', '1219\\tTRUMP\\tAnd they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.\\t0', \"1220\\tTRUMP\\tAnd when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?\\t0\", \"1221\\tTRUMP\\tWhy didn't you add other things into the deal?\\t0\", '1222\\tTRUMP\\tOne of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.\\t1', \"1223\\tTRUMP\\tNobody's ever seen that before.\\t0\", '1224\\tTRUMP\\tThat turned out to be wrong.\\t0', '1225\\tTRUMP\\tIt was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.\\t1', '1226\\tTRUMP\\tIt certainly looks that way.\\t0', \"1227\\tTRUMP\\tSo you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?\\t0\", '1228\\tTRUMP\\tThis is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.\\t0', '1229\\tTRUMP\\tThe deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.\\t0', \"1230\\tTRUMP\\tAll they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.\\t0\", '1231\\tHOLT\\tYour two minutes is expired.\\t0', \"1232\\tTRUMP\\tAnd they're going to end up getting nuclear.\\t0\",

'1239\\tCLINTON\\tAnd they really matter when you are president.\\t0', '1240\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.\\t0', \"1241\\tCLINTON\\tIt is essential that America's word be good.\\t0\", '1242\\tCLINTON\\tAnd so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.\\t0', \"1243\\tCLINTON\\tI've talked with a number of them.\\t0\", '1244\\tCLINTON\\tBut I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.\\t0', \"1245\\tCLINTON\\tIt's also important that we look at the entire global situation.\\t0\", \"1246\\tCLINTON\\tThere's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.\\t0\", \"1247\\tCLINTON\\tBut personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.\\t0\", '1248\\tCLINTON\\tAnd Donald never tells you what he would do.\\t0', '1249\\tCLINTON\\tWould he have started a war?\\t0', '1250\\tCLINTON\\tWould he have bombed Iran?\\t0', \"1251\\tCLINTON\\tIf he's

commercials.\\t0', \"1347\\tTRUMP\\tSome of it's said in entertainment.\\t0\", \"1348\\tTRUMP\\tSome of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.\\t0\", '1349\\tTRUMP\\tBut you want to know the truth?\\t0', '1350\\tTRUMP\\tI was going to say something...\\t0', '1351\\tHOLT\\tPlease very quickly.\\t0', '1352\\tTRUMP\\t... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, \"I can\\'t do it.\\t0', \"1353\\tTRUMP\\tI just can't do it.\\t0\", \"1354\\tTRUMP\\tIt's inappropriate.\\t0\", '1355\\tTRUMP\\tIt\\'s not nice.\"\\t0', '1356\\tTRUMP\\tBut she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.\\t0', \"1357\\tTRUMP\\tThey're untrue.\\t0\", \"1358\\tTRUMP\\tAnd they're misrepresentations.\\t0\", \"1359\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.\\t0\", \"1360\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I don't deserve that.\\t0\", \"1361\\tTRUMP\\tBut it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.\\t0\", \"1362\\tTRUMP\\tIt's hundreds of millions of ads.\\t0\", '1363\\tTRUMP\\tAnd the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...\\t0', '1364\\tHOLT\\tWe have to move on to the final question.\\t0', \"1365\\tTRUMP\\t$200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.\\t0\", '1366\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', '1367\\tHOLT\\tOne of you will not win this election.\\t0', '1368\\tHOLT\\tSo my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters?\\t0', '1369\\tHOLT\\tSecretary Clinton?\\t0', '1370\\tCLINTON\\tWell, I support our democracy.\\t0', '1371\\tCLINTON\\tAnd sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\\t0', '1372\\tCLINTON\\tBut I certainly will support the outcome of this election.\\t0', \"1373\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.\\t0\", \"1374\\tCLINTON\\tIt's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.\\t0\", '1375\\tCLINTON\\tSo I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.\\t0', '1376\\tHOLT\\tMr. Trump, very quickly, same question.\\t0', '1377\\tHOLT\\tWill you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?\\t0', '1378\\tTRUMP\\tI want to make America great again.\\t0', '1379\\tTRUMP\\tWe are a nation that is seriously troubled.\\t0', \"1380\\tTRUMP\\tWe're losing our jobs.\\t0\", '1381\\tTRUMP\\tPeople are pouring into our country.\\t0', '1382\\tTRUMP\\tThe other day, we were deporting 800 people.\\t0', '1383\\tTRUMP\\tAnd perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens.\\t0', '1384\\tTRUMP\\tEnded up becoming citizens.\\t0', '1385\\tTRUMP\\tAnd it was 800.\\t0', \"1386\\tTRUMP\\tAnd now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.\\t0\", '1387\\tHOLT\\tWill you accept the outcome of the election?\\t0', \"1388\\tTRUMP\\tLook, here's the story.\\t0\", '1389\\tTRUMP\\tI want to make America great again.\\t0', \"1390\\tTRUMP\\tI'm going to be able to do it.\\t0\", \"1391\\tTRUMP\\tI don't believe Hillary will.\\t0\", '1392\\tTRUMP\\tThe answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.\\t0', '1393\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', '1394\\tHOLT\\tAll right.\\t0', '1395\\tHOLT\\tWell, that is going to do it for us.\\t0', '1396\\tHOLT\\tThat concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one.\\t0', '1397\\tHOLT\\tWe covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.\\t0', '1398\\tHOLT\\tThe next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.\\t0', '1399\\tHOLT\\tThe conversation will continue.\\t0', '1400\\tHOLT\\tA reminder.\\t0', '1401\\tHOLT\\tThe vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.\\t0', '1402\\tHOLT\\tMy thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight.\\t0', '1403\\tHOLT\\tGood night, everyone.\\t0', '1\\tRADDATZ\\tLadies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.\\t0', '2\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', '3\\tCOOPER\\tThank you very much for being here.\\t0', \"4\\tCOOPER\\tWe're going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall.\\t0\", '5\\tCOOPER\\tEach of you will have two minutes to respond to this question.\\t0', \"6\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you'll go first.\\t0\", '7\\tCOOPER\\tOur first question comes from Patrice Brock.\\t0', '8\\tCOOPER\\tPatrice?\\t0', '9\\tQUESTION\\tThank you, and good evening.\\t0', '10\\tQUESTION\\tThe last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines.\\t0', \"11\\tQUESTION\\tKnowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students' homework, do you feel you're modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today's youth?\\t0\", '12\\tCLINTON\\tWell, thank you.\\t0', '13\\tCLINTON\\tAre you a teacher?\\t0', \"14\\tCLINTON\\tYes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.\\t0\", \"15\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.\\t0\", '16\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.\\t0', '17\\tCLINTON\\tWe are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.\\t0', '18\\tCLINTON\\tI have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.\\t0', '19\\tCLINTON\\tThat\\'s why the slogan of my campaign is \"Stronger Together,\" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I\\'ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.\\t0', \"20\\tCLINTON\\tIf we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.\\t0\", \"21\\tCLINTON\\tSo that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.\\t0\", \"22\\tCLINTON\\tObviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.\\t0\", '23\\tCLINTON\\tI want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.\\t0', \"24\\tCLINTON\\tI want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.\\t0\", '25\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton, thank you.\\t0', '26\\tCOOPER\\tMr. Trump, you have two minutes.\\t0', '27\\tTRUMP\\tWell, I actually agree with that.\\t0', '28\\tTRUMP\\tI agree with everything she said.\\t0', '29\\tTRUMP\\tI began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.\\t0', '30\\tTRUMP\\tThis is a great country.\\t0', '31\\tTRUMP\\tThis is a great land.\\t0', \"32\\tTRUMP\\tI've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.\\t0\", \"33\\tTRUMP\\tI cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.\\t0\", '34\\tTRUMP\\tAnd my whole concept was to make America great again.\\t0', \"35\\tTRUMP\\tWhen I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.\\t1\", \"36\\tTRUMP\\tWhen I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.\\t0\", '37\\tTRUMP\\tLast year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.\\t1', '38\\tTRUMP\\tIn other words, trading with other countries.\\t0', '39\\tTRUMP\\tWe had an $800 billion deficit.\\t1', \"40\\tTRUMP\\tIt's hard to believe.\\t0\", '41\\tTRUMP\\tInconceivable.\\t0', \"42\\tTRUMP\\tYou say who's making these deals?\\t0\", \"43\\tTRUMP\\tWe're going the make great deals.\\t0\", \"44\\tTRUMP\\tWe're going to have a strong border.\\t0\", \"45\\tTRUMP\\tWe're going to bring back law and order.\\t0\", '46\\tTRUMP\\tJust today, policemen was shot, two killed.\\t0', '47\\tTRUMP\\tAnd this is happening on a weekly basis.\\t0', '48\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to bring back respect to law enforcement.\\t0', '49\\tTRUMP\\tAt the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.\\t0', '50\\tTRUMP\\tWe need justice.\\t0', \"51\\tTRUMP\\tBut I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.\\t0\", \"52\\tTRUMP\\tIt's called make America great again.\\t0\", '53\\tCOOPER\\tThank you, Mr. Trump.\\t0', \"54\\tCOOPER\\tThe question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth?\\t0\", '55\\tCOOPER\\tWe received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine.\\t0', '56\\tCOOPER\\tYou called what you said locker room banter.\\t0', '57\\tCOOPER\\tYou described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals.\\t0', '58\\tCOOPER\\tThat is sexual assault.\\t0', '59\\tCOOPER\\tYou bragged that you have sexually assaulted women.\\t0', '60\\tCOOPER\\tDo you understand that?\\t0', \"61\\tTRUMP\\tNo, I didn't say that at all.\\t0\", \"62\\tTRUMP\\tI don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.\\t0\", \"63\\tTRUMP\\tI'm not proud of it.\\t0\", '64\\tTRUMP\\tI apologize to my family.\\t0', '65\\tTRUMP\\tI apologize to the American people.\\t0', \"66\\tTRUMP\\tCertainly I'm not proud of it.\\t0\", '67\\tTRUMP\\tBut this is locker room talk.\\t0', '68\\tTRUMP\\tYou know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.\\t0', \"69\\tTRUMP\\tWe haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.\\t0\", '70\\tTRUMP\\tAnd they look and they see.\\t0', '71\\tTRUMP\\tCan you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?\\t0', \"72\\tTRUMP\\tAnd they look at our country and they see what's going on.\\t0\", \"73\\tTRUMP\\tYes, I'm very embarrassed by it.\\t0\", '74\\tTRUMP\\tI hate it.\\t0', \"75\\tTRUMP\\tBut it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.\\t0\", '76\\tTRUMP\\tI will knock the hell out of ISIS.\\t0', \"77\\tTRUMP\\tWe're going to defeat ISIS.\\t0\", '78\\tTRUMP\\tISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.\\t0', '79\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.\\t0', '80\\tCOOPER\\tSo, Mr. Trump...\\t0', '81\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.\\t0', '82\\tCOOPER\\tJust for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?\\t0', '83\\tTRUMP\\tI have great respect for women.\\t0', '84\\tTRUMP\\tNobody has more respect for women than I do.\\t0', \"85\\tCOOPER\\tSo, for the record, you're saying you never did that?\\t0\", \"86\\tTRUMP\\tI've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.\\t0\", '87\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I was embarrassed by it.\\t0', '88\\tTRUMP\\tBut I have tremendous respect for women.\\t0', '89\\tCOOPER\\tHave you ever done those things?\\t0', '90\\tTRUMP\\tAnd women have respect for me.\\t0', '91\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I will tell you: No, I have not.\\t0', \"92\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.\\t0\", \"93\\tTRUMP\\tWe're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.\\t0\", \"94\\tTRUMP\\tPeople are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.\\t0\", \"95\\tTRUMP\\tWe're going to make America safe again.\\t0\", \"96\\tTRUMP\\tWe're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.\\t0\", \"97\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.\\t0\", '98\\tCOOPER\\tThank you, Mr. Trump.\\t0', \"99\\tTRUMP\\tRight now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.\\t0\", '100\\tCOOPER\\tThank you, Mr. Trump.\\t0', \"101\\tTRUMP\\tAnd that's what I want to talk about.\\t0\", '102\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton, do you want to respond?\\t0', \"103\\tCLINTON\\tWell, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.\\t0\", '104\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.\\t0', '105\\tCLINTON\\tDonald Trump is different.\\t0', '106\\tCLINTON\\tI said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.\\t0', '107\\tCLINTON\\tAnd many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.\\t0', '108\\tCLINTON\\tWhat we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.\\t0', \"109\\tCLINTON\\tAnd he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.\\t0\", \"110\\tCLINTON\\tBut I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.\\t0\", \"111\\tCLINTON\\tBecause we've seen this throughout the campaign.\\t0\", '112\\tCLINTON\\tWe have seen him insult women.\\t0', \"113\\tCLINTON\\tWe've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.\\t0\", \"114\\tCLINTON\\tWe've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.\\t0\", '115\\tCLINTON\\tWe saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.\\t0', '116\\tCLINTON\\tSo, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.\\t0', \"117\\tCLINTON\\tBut it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.\\t0\", '118\\tCLINTON\\tSo this is who Donald Trump is.\\t0', '119\\tCLINTON\\tAnd the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.\\t0', \"120\\tCLINTON\\tThat's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.\\t0\", '121\\tCLINTON\\tThese are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.\\t0', \"122\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.\\t0\", '123\\tRADDATZ\\tAnd we want to get to some questions from online...\\t0', '124\\tTRUMP\\tAm I allowed to respond to that?\\t0', '125\\tTRUMP\\tI assume I am.\\t0', '126\\tRADDATZ\\tYes, you can respond to that.\\t0', \"127\\tTRUMP\\tIt's just words, folks.\\t0\", \"128\\tTRUMP\\tIt's just words.\\t0\", \"129\\tTRUMP\\tThose words, I've been hearing them for many years.\\t0\", '130\\tTRUMP\\tI heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.\\t0', \"131\\tTRUMP\\tI've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.\\t0\", \"132\\tTRUMP\\tI'm going to help the African-Americans.\\t0\", \"133\\tTRUMP\\tI'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.\\t0\", '134\\tTRUMP\\tI am going to help the inner cities.\\t0', \"135\\tTRUMP\\tShe's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.\\t0\", '136\\tTRUMP\\tShe wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.\\t0', '137\\tTRUMP\\tWe saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.\\t0', '138\\tTRUMP\\tShe campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...\\t0', '139\\tRADDATZ\\tMr. Trump, Mr. Trump -- I want to get to audience questions and online questions.\\t0', \"140\\tTRUMP\\tSo, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?\\t0\", \"141\\tRADDATZ\\tYou're going to have -- you're going to get to respond right now.\\t0\", '142\\tTRUMP\\tSounds fair.\\t0', '143\\tRADDATZ\\tThis tape is generating intense interest.\\t0', \"144\\tRADDATZ\\tIn just 48 hours, it's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network.\\t0\", '145\\tRADDATZ\\tAs we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic.\\t0', '146\\tRADDATZ\\tJeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, \"Trump says the campaign has changed him.\\t0', '147\\tRADDATZ\\tWhen did that happen?\"\\t0', '148\\tRADDATZ\\tSo, Mr. Trump, let me add to that.\\t0', '149\\tRADDATZ\\tWhen you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently?\\t0', '150\\tRADDATZ\\tAnd you have two minutes for this.\\t0', '151\\tTRUMP\\tIt was locker room talk, as I told you.\\t0', '152\\tTRUMP\\tThat was locker room talk.\\t0', \"153\\tTRUMP\\tI'm not proud of it.\\t0\", '154\\tTRUMP\\tI am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.\\t0', \"155\\tTRUMP\\tAnd certainly, I'm not proud of it.\\t0\", '156\\tTRUMP\\tBut that was something that happened.\\t0', '157\\tTRUMP\\tIf you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.\\t0', '158\\tTRUMP\\tMine are words, and his was action.\\t0', \"159\\tTRUMP\\tHis was what he's done to women.\\t0\", \"160\\tTRUMP\\tThere's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.\\t0\", '161\\tTRUMP\\tSo you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.\\t1', '162\\tTRUMP\\tHillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.\\t0', '163\\tTRUMP\\tFour of them here tonight.\\t0', '164\\tTRUMP\\tOne of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.\\t1', \"165\\tTRUMP\\tHer client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.\\t1\", '166\\tTRUMP\\tKathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.\\t0', \"167\\tTRUMP\\tSo don't tell me about words.\\t0\", '168\\tTRUMP\\tI am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.\\t0', '169\\tTRUMP\\tBut it is things that people say.\\t0', '170\\tTRUMP\\tBut what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.\\t0', '171\\tTRUMP\\tHe had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.\\t0', \"172\\tTRUMP\\tPaula Jones, who's also here tonight.\\t0\", \"173\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.\\t0\", '174\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', '175\\tRADDATZ\\tCan we please hold the applause?\\t0', '176\\tRADDATZ\\tSecretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\\t0', \"177\\tCLINTON\\tWell, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.\\t0\", '178\\tCLINTON\\tHe gets to decide what he wants to talk about.\\t0', \"179\\tCLINTON\\tInstead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.\\t0\", '180\\tCLINTON\\tWhen I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.\\t0', '181\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', \"182\\tCLINTON\\tAnd, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.\\t0\", '183\\tCLINTON\\tBut he never apologizes for anything to anyone.\\t0', '184\\tCLINTON\\tHe never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.\\t0', '185\\tCLINTON\\tAnd Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.\\t0', '186\\tCLINTON\\tHe never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn\\'t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \"Mexican.\"\\t0', '187\\tCLINTON\\tHe never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.\\t0', '188\\tCLINTON\\tAnd he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.\\t0', '189\\tCLINTON\\tHe owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.\\t0', \"190\\tTRUMP\\tWell, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.\\t1\", '191\\tTRUMP\\tSo you really owe him an apology.\\t0', \"192\\tTRUMP\\tYou're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.\\t0\", '193\\tTRUMP\\tThat was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.\\t0', '194\\tTRUMP\\tNumber two, Michelle Obama.\\t0', \"195\\tTRUMP\\tI've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.\\t0\", \"196\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.\\t0\", '197\\tTRUMP\\tSo, you talk about friend?\\t0', '198\\tTRUMP\\tGo back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.\\t0', '199\\tTRUMP\\tAnd all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.\\t0', '200\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.\\t0', '201\\tTRUMP\\tBut when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.\\t0', \"202\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I'll tell you what.\\t0\", \"203\\tTRUMP\\tI didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.\\t0\", '204\\tTRUMP\\tBut if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.\\t0', \"205\\tTRUMP\\tThere has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.\\t0\", '206\\tTRUMP\\tWhen I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.\\t0', '207\\tTRUMP\\tIn my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.\\t0', '208\\tTRUMP\\tThere has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.\\t1', \"209\\tTRUMP\\tSo we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?\\t0\", \"210\\tTRUMP\\tPeople have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.\\t0\", \"211\\tTRUMP\\tAnd it's a disgrace.\\t0\", '212\\tTRUMP\\tAnd honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\\t0', '213\\tRADDATZ\\tSecretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.\\t0', '214\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', \"215\\tRADDATZ\\tI'm going to let you talk about e-mails.\\t0\", \"216\\tCLINTON\\tbecause everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.\\t0\", '217\\tTRUMP\\tOh, really?\\t0', '218\\tCLINTON\\tIn the first debate...\\t0', '219\\tSYSTEM\\t(LAUGHTER)\\t0', '220\\tRADDATZ\\tAnd really, the audience needs to calm down here.\\t0', '221\\tCLINTON\\tI told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.\\t0', \"222\\tCLINTON\\tI'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.\\t0\", '223\\tCLINTON\\tSo, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.\\t0', '224\\tCLINTON\\tWe have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.\\t0', \"225\\tCLINTON\\tLast time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\\t0\", \"226\\tTRUMP\\tBecause you'd be in jail.\\t0\", '227\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', '228\\tRADDATZ\\tSecretary Clinton...\\t0', '229\\tCOOPER\\tWe want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud.\\t0', '230\\tCOOPER\\tPlease do not applaud.\\t0', \"231\\tCOOPER\\tYou're just wasting time.\\t0\", '232\\tRADDATZ\\tAnd, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails.\\t0', \"233\\tRADDATZ\\tYou've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake.\\t0\", '234\\tRADDATZ\\tYou disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, \"extremely careless.\"\\t0', '235\\tRADDATZ\\tThe FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails.\\t0', \"236\\tRADDATZ\\tYou don't call that extremely careless?\\t0\", \"237\\tCLINTON\\tWell, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.\\t0\", '238\\tCLINTON\\tObviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.\\t0', \"239\\tCLINTON\\tI'm not making any excuses.\\t0\", '240\\tCLINTON\\tIt was a mistake.\\t0', '241\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I am very sorry about that.\\t0', \"242\\tCLINTON\\tBut I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.\\t0\", '243\\tCLINTON\\tAfter a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.\\t1', '244\\tCLINTON\\tI take classified materials very seriously and always have.\\t0', '245\\tCLINTON\\tWhen I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material.\\t0', '246\\tCLINTON\\tObviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden.\\t0', '247\\tCLINTON\\tSo I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.\\t0', '248\\tCLINTON\\tAnd as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.\\t0', \"249\\tRADDATZ\\tOK, we're going to move on.\\t0\", \"250\\tTRUMP\\tAnd yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.\\t0\", '251\\tTRUMP\\tRight?\\t0', \"252\\tTRUMP\\tShe didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.\\t0\", \"253\\tTRUMP\\tYou know, it's amazing.\\t0\", \"254\\tTRUMP\\tI'm watching Hillary go over facts.\\t0\", \"255\\tTRUMP\\tAnd she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.\\t0\", '256\\tTRUMP\\tYou think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?\\t0', \"257\\tTRUMP\\tI don't think so.\\t0\", \"258\\tTRUMP\\tShe said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.\\t0\", \"259\\tTRUMP\\tWell, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.\\t0\", \"260\\tTRUMP\\t33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.\\t0\", '261\\tTRUMP\\tAnd more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.\\t0', \"262\\tTRUMP\\tThat wasn't before.\\t0\", '263\\tTRUMP\\tThat was after.\\t0', '264\\tTRUMP\\tShe got it from the United States Congress.\\t0', \"265\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.\\t0\", '266\\tTRUMP\\tOur Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.\\t0', '267\\tTRUMP\\tBut for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.\\t0', '268\\tTRUMP\\tWhat you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\\t0', '269\\tCOOPER\\tWe have to move on.\\t0', '270\\tTRUMP\\tYou did that.\\t0', '271\\tTRUMP\\tWait a minute.\\t0', '272\\tTRUMP\\tOne second.\\t0', '273\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.\\t0', '274\\tRADDATZ\\tWe want to give the audience a chance.\\t0', \"275\\tTRUMP\\tIf you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\\t0\", '276\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton, you can respond.\\t0', '277\\tCOOPER\\tThen we have to move on to an audience question.\\t0', \"278\\tCLINTON\\tLook, it's just not true.\\t0\", '279\\tCLINTON\\tAnd so please, go to...\\t0', \"280\\tTRUMP\\tOh, you didn't delete them?\\t0\", '281\\tCOOPER\\tAllow her to respond, please.\\t0', '282\\tCLINTON\\tIt was personal e-mails, not official.\\t0', '283\\tTRUMP\\tOh, 33,000?\\t0', '284\\tTRUMP\\tYeah.\\t0', '285\\tCLINTON\\tNot -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...\\t0', '286\\tTRUMP\\tOh, yeah.\\t0', '287\\tTRUMP\\tWhat about the other 15,000?\\t0', '288\\tCOOPER\\tPlease allow her to respond.\\t0', \"289\\tCOOPER\\tShe didn't talk while you talked.\\t0\", \"290\\tCLINTON\\tYes, that's true, I didn't.\\t0\", '291\\tTRUMP\\tBecause you have nothing to say.\\t0', \"292\\tCLINTON\\tI didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.\\t0\", '293\\tTRUMP\\tGet off this question.\\t0', '294\\tCLINTON\\tOK, Donald.\\t0', \"295\\tCLINTON\\tI know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.\\t0\", \"296\\tCLINTON\\tBut let's at least focus...\\t0\", \"297\\tTRUMP\\tLet's see what happens...\\t0\", '298\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '299\\tCOOPER\\tAllow her to respond.\\t0', '300\\tCLINTON\\ton some of the issues that people care about tonight.\\t0', \"301\\tCLINTON\\tLet's get to their questions.\\t0\", '302\\tCOOPER\\tWe have a question here from Ken Karpowicz.\\t0', '303\\tCOOPER\\tHe has a question about health care.\\t0', '304\\tCOOPER\\tKen?\\t0', \"305\\tTRUMP\\tI'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?\\t0\", \"306\\tTRUMP\\tI'd like to know.\\t0\", \"307\\tTRUMP\\tWhy aren't you bringing...\\t0\", '308\\tCOOPER\\tWe brought up the e-mails.\\t0', \"309\\tTRUMP\\tNo, it hasn't.\\t0\", \"310\\tTRUMP\\tIt hasn't.\\t0\", \"311\\tTRUMP\\tAnd it hasn't been finished at all.\\t0\", '312\\tCOOPER\\tKen Karpowicz has a question.\\t0', \"313\\tTRUMP\\tIt's nice to -- one on three.\\t0\", '314\\tQUESTION\\tThank you.\\t0', '315\\tQUESTION\\tAffordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable.\\t0', '316\\tQUESTION\\tPremiums have gone up.\\t0', '317\\tQUESTION\\tDeductibles have gone up.\\t0', '318\\tQUESTION\\tCopays have gone up.\\t0', '319\\tQUESTION\\tPrescriptions have gone up.\\t0', '320\\tQUESTION\\tAnd the coverage has gone down.\\t0', '321\\tQUESTION\\tWhat will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?\\t0', '322\\tCOOPER\\tThat first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.\\t0', '323\\tCLINTON\\tIf he wants to start, he can start.\\t0', '324\\tCLINTON\\tNo, go ahead, Donald.\\t0', \"325\\tTRUMP\\tNo, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.\\t0\", '326\\tTRUMP\\tGo ahead.\\t0', '327\\tSYSTEM\\t(LAUGHTER)\\t0', '328\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton?\\t0', \"329\\tCLINTON\\tWell, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.\\t0\", \"330\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.\\t0\", '331\\tCLINTON\\tPremiums have gotten too high.\\t0', \"332\\tCLINTON\\tCopays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.\\t0\", \"333\\tCLINTON\\tBut here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.\\t0\", '334\\tCLINTON\\tBut that in and of itself was a good thing.\\t0', '335\\tCLINTON\\tI meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.\\t0', '336\\tCLINTON\\tBut everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.\\t0', \"337\\tCLINTON\\tNumber one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.\\t0\", '338\\tCLINTON\\tNumber two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.\\t0', \"339\\tCLINTON\\tNumber three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.\\t0\", \"340\\tCLINTON\\tNumber four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.\\t1\", '341\\tCLINTON\\tSo I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.\\t0', \"342\\tCLINTON\\tBut we've got to get costs down.\\t0\", \"343\\tCLINTON\\tWe've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.\\t0\", '344\\tCLINTON\\tBut if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.\\t0', '345\\tCLINTON\\tAnd then we would have to start all over again.\\t0', '346\\tCLINTON\\tRight now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.\\t0', \"347\\tCLINTON\\tThat's the highest we've ever been in our country.\\t0\", '348\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton, your time is up.\\t0', '349\\tCLINTON\\tSo I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.\\t0', '350\\tCOOPER\\tMr. Trump, you have two minutes.\\t0', \"351\\tTRUMP\\tIt is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.\\t0\", '352\\tTRUMP\\tObamacare is a disaster.\\t0', '353\\tTRUMP\\tYou know it.\\t0', '354\\tTRUMP\\tWe all know it.\\t0', \"355\\tTRUMP\\tIt's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.\\t0\", \"356\\tTRUMP\\tNobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.\\t0\", \"357\\tTRUMP\\tIt's only getting worse.\\t0\", \"358\\tTRUMP\\tIn '17, it implodes by itself.\\t0\", '359\\tTRUMP\\tTheir method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.\\t0', '360\\tTRUMP\\tWe have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.\\t0', '361\\tTRUMP\\tObamacare will never work.\\t0', \"362\\tTRUMP\\tIt's very bad, very bad health insurance.\\t0\", '363\\tTRUMP\\tFar too expensive.\\t0', '364\\tTRUMP\\tAnd not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.\\t0', \"365\\tTRUMP\\tIt's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.\\t0\", '366\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.\\t0', '367\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.\\t0', '368\\tTRUMP\\tWe want competition.\\t0', '369\\tTRUMP\\tYou will have the finest health care plan there is.\\t0', '370\\tTRUMP\\tShe wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.\\t1', \"371\\tTRUMP\\tAnd if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.\\t0\", \"372\\tTRUMP\\tIt's catastrophic in certain ways.\\t0\", '373\\tTRUMP\\tBut she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.\\t0', '374\\tTRUMP\\tHillary Clinton has been after this for years.\\t0', '375\\tTRUMP\\tObamacare was the first step.\\t0', '376\\tTRUMP\\tObamacare is a total disaster.\\t0', \"377\\tTRUMP\\tAnd not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.\\t0\", '378\\tCOOPER\\tMr. Trump, your time...\\t0', '379\\tTRUMP\\tIt is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.\\t0', '380\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton, let me follow up with you.\\t0', '381\\tCOOPER\\tYour husband called Obamacare, quote, \"the craziest thing in the world,\" saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half.\\t0', '382\\tCOOPER\\tWas he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?\\t0', '383\\tCLINTON\\tNo, I mean, he clarified what he meant.\\t0', \"384\\tCLINTON\\tAnd it's very clear.\\t0\", '385\\tCLINTON\\tLook, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.\\t0', '386\\tCLINTON\\tBut we have an employer-based system.\\t0', \"387\\tCLINTON\\tThat's where the vast majority of people get their health care.\\t0\", \"388\\tCLINTON\\tAnd the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.\\t0\", \"389\\tCLINTON\\tObviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.\\t0\", '390\\tCLINTON\\tThat was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.\\t0', '391\\tCLINTON\\tAnd like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.\\t0', \"392\\tCLINTON\\tSo if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...\\t0\", '393\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton...\\t0', \"394\\tCLINTON\\tget to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...\\t0\", '395\\tCOOPER\\tYour time is up.\\t0', \"396\\tCLINTON\\tyou may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.\\t0\", \"397\\tCLINTON\\tSo let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.\\t0\", \"398\\tCLINTON\\tThat's not going to work.\\t0\", '399\\tCOOPER\\tMr. Trump, let me follow up on this.\\t0', '400\\tTRUMP\\tWell, I just want -- just one thing.\\t0', \"401\\tTRUMP\\tFirst of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.\\t0\", '402\\tTRUMP\\tEverything.\\t0', '403\\tTRUMP\\tNumber two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.\\t0', '404\\tTRUMP\\tThis is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.\\t0', \"405\\tCOOPER\\tYou've said you want to end Obamacare...\\t0\", '406\\tTRUMP\\tBy the way...\\t0', \"407\\tCOOPER\\tYou've said you want to end Obamacare.\\t0\", \"408\\tCOOPER\\tYou've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions.\\t0\", \"409\\tCOOPER\\tHow do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every American get insurance?\\t0\", \"410\\tTRUMP\\tWe're going to be able to.\\t0\", \"411\\tTRUMP\\tYou're going to have plans...\\t0\", '412\\tCOOPER\\tWhat does that mean?\\t0', \"413\\tTRUMP\\tWell, I'll tell you what it means.\\t0\", \"414\\tTRUMP\\tYou're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.\\t0\", '415\\tTRUMP\\tOnce we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...\\t0', '416\\tCOOPER\\tAre you going -- are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?\\t0', '417\\tTRUMP\\tPresident Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.\\t0', '418\\tTRUMP\\tPresident Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.\\t0', '419\\tTRUMP\\tYou know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.\\t0', '420\\tTRUMP\\tPresident Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.\\t0', \"421\\tTRUMP\\tThe whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.\\t0\", \"422\\tTRUMP\\tBut when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.\\t0\", '423\\tTRUMP\\tAnd Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.\\t0', \"424\\tTRUMP\\tWe're going to block grant into the states.\\t0\", \"425\\tTRUMP\\tWe're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...\\t0\", '426\\tCOOPER\\tThank you, Mr. Trump.\\t0', '427\\tTRUMP\\tso that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.\\t0', '428\\tCOOPER\\tThank you, Mr. Trump.\\t0', '429\\tRADDATZ\\tWe now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.\\t0', '430\\tQUESTION\\tHi.\\t0', \"431\\tQUESTION\\tThere are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I'm one of them.\\t0\", \"432\\tQUESTION\\tYou've mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?\\t0\", \"433\\tRADDATZ\\tMr. Trump, you're first.\\t0\", \"434\\tTRUMP\\tWell, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.\\t0\", '435\\tTRUMP\\tBut one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.\\t0', '436\\tTRUMP\\tI mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.\\t0', '437\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.\\t0', '438\\tTRUMP\\tWhen they see hatred going on, they have to report it.\\t0', '439\\tTRUMP\\tAs an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.\\t1', '440\\tTRUMP\\tHorribly wounded.\\t0', \"441\\tTRUMP\\tThey'll never be the same.\\t0\", '442\\tTRUMP\\tMuslims have to report the problems when they see them.\\t0', \"443\\tTRUMP\\tAnd, you know, there's always a reason for everything.\\t0\", \"444\\tTRUMP\\tIf they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.\\t0\", '445\\tTRUMP\\tGo outside.\\t0', '446\\tTRUMP\\tLook at Paris.\\t0', '447\\tTRUMP\\tLook at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.\\t0', \"448\\tTRUMP\\tAnd she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.\\t0\", '449\\tTRUMP\\tHe won\\'t use the term \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"\\t0', '450\\tTRUMP\\tNow, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.\\t0', \"451\\tTRUMP\\tShe won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.\\t0\", '452\\tTRUMP\\tBut the name is there.\\t0', \"453\\tTRUMP\\tIt's radical Islamic terror.\\t0\", '454\\tTRUMP\\tAnd before you solve it, you have to say the name.\\t0', '455\\tRADDATZ\\tSecretary Clinton?\\t0', '456\\tCLINTON\\tWell, thank you for asking your question.\\t0', \"457\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.\\t0\", '458\\tCLINTON\\tAnd even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.\\t0', '459\\tCLINTON\\tI want to say just a couple of things.\\t0', \"460\\tCLINTON\\tFirst, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.\\t0\", \"461\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we've had many successful Muslims.\\t0\", '462\\tCLINTON\\tWe just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.\\t0', \"463\\tCLINTON\\tMy vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.\\t0\", \"464\\tCLINTON\\tThat's what America is.\\t0\", \"465\\tCLINTON\\tThat's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.\\t0\", \"466\\tCLINTON\\tIt's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.\\t0\", '467\\tCLINTON\\tWe need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.\\t0', \"468\\tCLINTON\\tI've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.\\t0\", \"469\\tCLINTON\\tI've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.\\t0\", \"470\\tCLINTON\\tIt's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.\\t0\", '471\\tCLINTON\\tRight now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?\\t0', '472\\tCLINTON\\tAnd this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.\\t0', '473\\tCLINTON\\tWe are not at war with Islam.\\t0', '474\\tCLINTON\\tAnd it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.\\t0', '475\\tCLINTON\\tSo I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.\\t0', '476\\tRADDATZ\\tThank you, Secretary Clinton.\\t0', '477\\tRADDATZ\\tMr. Trump, in December, you said this.\\t0', \"478\\tRADDATZ\\tDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\\t0\", '479\\tRADDATZ\\tWe have no choice.\\t0', '480\\tRADDATZ\\tWe have no choice.\\t0', '481\\tRADDATZ\\tYour running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position.\\t0', '482\\tRADDATZ\\tIs that correct?\\t0', '483\\tRADDATZ\\tAnd if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?\\t0', '484\\tTRUMP\\tFirst of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.\\t0', '485\\tTRUMP\\tIraq was disaster.\\t0', '486\\tTRUMP\\tSo he would have been alive today.\\t0', '487\\tTRUMP\\tThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.\\t0', '488\\tTRUMP\\tHillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.\\t0', '489\\tTRUMP\\tExcuse me..\\t0', '490\\tRADDATZ\\tAnd why did it morph into that?\\t0', '491\\tRADDATZ\\tNo, did you -- no, answer the question.\\t0', '492\\tRADDATZ\\tDo you still believe...\\t0', \"493\\tTRUMP\\tWhy don't you interrupt her?\\t0\", '494\\tTRUMP\\tYou interrupt me all the time.\\t0', '495\\tRADDATZ\\tI do.\\t0', \"496\\tTRUMP\\tWhy don't you interrupt her?\\t0\", '497\\tRADDATZ\\tWould you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?\\t0', \"498\\tTRUMP\\tIt's called extreme vetting.\\t0\", \"499\\tTRUMP\\tWe are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.\\t0\", '500\\tTRUMP\\tAnd Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.\\t0', '501\\tTRUMP\\tPeople are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.\\t0', '502\\tTRUMP\\tThis is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.\\t0', '503\\tTRUMP\\tWe have enough problems in this country.\\t0', '504\\tTRUMP\\tI believe in building safe zones.\\t0', '505\\tTRUMP\\tI believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.\\t0', \"506\\tTRUMP\\tBut I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.\\t0\", '507\\tTRUMP\\tWe know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.\\t0', '508\\tRADDATZ\\tAnd, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees.\\t0', '509\\tRADDATZ\\tWe know you want tougher vetting.\\t0', \"510\\tRADDATZ\\tThat's not a perfect system.\\t0\", '511\\tRADDATZ\\tSo why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?\\t0', '512\\tCLINTON\\tWell, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.\\t0', \"513\\tCLINTON\\tBut there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.\\t0\", '514\\tCLINTON\\tThere are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.\\t0', '515\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we need to do our part.\\t0', '516\\tCLINTON\\tWe by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.\\t0', '517\\tCLINTON\\tBut we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.\\t0', \"518\\tCLINTON\\tBut it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.\\t0\", '519\\tCLINTON\\tHow do you do that?\\t0', '520\\tCLINTON\\tWe are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.\\t0', '521\\tCLINTON\\tHow do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?\\t0', '522\\tCLINTON\\tAre we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?\\t0', '523\\tCLINTON\\tAnd how do we expect to be able to implement those?\\t0', '524\\tCLINTON\\tSo I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.\\t0', '525\\tCLINTON\\tAnd indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.\\t0', \"526\\tCLINTON\\tAnd the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.\\t0\", '527\\tCLINTON\\tWe have it on tape.\\t0', '528\\tCLINTON\\tThe entire press corps has looked at it.\\t0', \"529\\tCLINTON\\tIt's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.\\t0\", \"530\\tTRUMP\\tThat's not been debunked.\\t0\", '531\\tCLINTON\\tSo, please...\\t0', '532\\tTRUMP\\tThat has not been debunked.\\t0', '533\\tCLINTON\\tgo to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.\\t0', '534\\tTRUMP\\tI was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.\\t1', '535\\tTRUMP\\tHas not been debunked.\\t0', '536\\tTRUMP\\tAnd you voted for it.\\t0', \"537\\tTRUMP\\tAnd you shouldn't have.\\t0\", '538\\tTRUMP\\tWell, I just want to say...\\t0', \"539\\tRADDATZ\\tThere's been lots of fact-checking on that.\\t0\", \"540\\tRADDATZ\\tI'd like to move on to an online question...\\t0\", '541\\tTRUMP\\tExcuse me.\\t0', '542\\tTRUMP\\tShe just went about 25 seconds over her time.\\t0', '543\\tRADDATZ\\tShe did not.\\t0', '544\\tTRUMP\\tCould I just respond to this, please?\\t0', '545\\tRADDATZ\\tVery quickly, please.\\t0', '546\\tTRUMP\\tHillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.\\t0', \"547\\tTRUMP\\tWhen we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.\\t0\", \"548\\tTRUMP\\tIn some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.\\t0\", \"549\\tTRUMP\\tAnd they don't want them.\\t0\", \"550\\tTRUMP\\tAnd Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.\\t0\", \"551\\tTRUMP\\tLet me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.\\t0\", \"552\\tTRUMP\\tThey're murderers and some very bad people.\\t0\", \"553\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.\\t0\", \"554\\tTRUMP\\tWe're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.\\t0\", '555\\tTRUMP\\tAt a record clip.\\t0', \"556\\tTRUMP\\tAnd it shouldn't be allowed to happen.\\t0\", '557\\tTRUMP\\tICE just endorsed me.\\t0', \"558\\tTRUMP\\tThey've never endorsed a presidential candidate.\\t0\", '559\\tTRUMP\\tThe Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.\\t0', \"560\\tTRUMP\\tShe doesn't.\\t0\", '561\\tTRUMP\\tShe wants amnesty for everybody.\\t0', '562\\tTRUMP\\tCome right in.\\t0', '563\\tTRUMP\\tCome right over.\\t0', \"564\\tTRUMP\\tIt's a horrible thing she's doing.\\t0\", \"565\\tTRUMP\\tShe's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.\\t0\", '566\\tTRUMP\\tThat I can tell you.\\t0', '567\\tRADDATZ\\tThank you, Mr. Trump.\\t0', '568\\tRADDATZ\\tI want to move on.\\t0', \"569\\tRADDATZ\\tThis next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition's online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes.\\t0\", \"570\\tRADDATZ\\tThis question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton's paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues.\\t0\", '571\\tRADDATZ\\tSo, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced?\\t0', '572\\tRADDATZ\\tIs it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues?\\t0', '573\\tRADDATZ\\tSecretary Clinton, your two minutes.\\t0', '574\\tCLINTON\\tWell, right.\\t0', '575\\tCLINTON\\tAs I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \"Lincoln.\"\\t0', '576\\tCLINTON\\tIt was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.\\t0', '577\\tCLINTON\\tIt was principled, and it was strategic.\\t0', '578\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.\\t0', '579\\tCLINTON\\tAnd, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.\\t0', '580\\tCLINTON\\tThat was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.\\t0', \"581\\tCLINTON\\tBut, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.\\t0\", \"582\\tCLINTON\\tAnd WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.\\t0\", '583\\tCLINTON\\tWe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.\\t0', \"584\\tCLINTON\\tAnd believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.\\t0\", \"585\\tCLINTON\\tThey're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\\t0\", \"586\\tCLINTON\\tNow, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.\\t0\", '587\\tCLINTON\\tBut we deserve answers.\\t0', '588\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...\\t0', \"589\\tRADDATZ\\tWe're going to get to that later.\\t0\", \"590\\tRADDATZ\\tSecretary Clinton, you're out of time.\\t0\", '591\\tCLINTON\\twith the Russians and other foreign powers.\\t0', '592\\tRADDATZ\\tMr. Trump?\\t0', '593\\tTRUMP\\tWell, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.\\t0', \"594\\tTRUMP\\tLook, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.\\t0\", '595\\tTRUMP\\tHer papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.\\t0', '596\\tTRUMP\\tAnd she lied.\\t0', \"597\\tTRUMP\\tNow she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.\\t0\", \"598\\tTRUMP\\tThat's one that I haven't...\\t0\", '599\\tSYSTEM\\t(LAUGHTER)\\t0', '600\\tTRUMP\\tOK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.\\t0', \"601\\tTRUMP\\tThat's the good thing.\\t0\", \"602\\tTRUMP\\tThat's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.\\t0\", \"603\\tTRUMP\\tThat's a big, big difference.\\t0\", \"604\\tTRUMP\\tWe're talking about some difference.\\t0\", \"605\\tTRUMP\\tBut as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.\\t0\", '606\\tTRUMP\\tI think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.\\t0', \"607\\tTRUMP\\tBut I don't know Putin.\\t0\", \"608\\tTRUMP\\tBut I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.\\t1\", '609\\tTRUMP\\tMaybe there is no hacking.\\t0', '610\\tTRUMP\\tBut they always blame Russia.\\t0', \"611\\tTRUMP\\tAnd the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.\\t0\", '612\\tTRUMP\\tI know nothing about Russia.\\t0', '613\\tTRUMP\\tI know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.\\t0', \"614\\tTRUMP\\tI don't deal there.\\t0\", '615\\tTRUMP\\tI have no businesses there.\\t0', '616\\tTRUMP\\tI have no loans from Russia.\\t0', '617\\tTRUMP\\tI have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.\\t0', '618\\tTRUMP\\tOne of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.\\t0', '619\\tTRUMP\\tBut I have no loans with Russia.\\t0', '620\\tTRUMP\\tYou could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.\\t0', '621\\tTRUMP\\tNow, the taxes are a very simple thing.\\t0', '622\\tTRUMP\\tAs soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.\\t0', '623\\tTRUMP\\tMany of her friends took bigger deductions.\\t0', '624\\tTRUMP\\tWarren Buffett took a massive deduction.\\t0', \"625\\tTRUMP\\tSoros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.\\t0\", '626\\tTRUMP\\tMany of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.\\t0', '627\\tTRUMP\\tI pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.\\t0', \"628\\tTRUMP\\tBut -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.\\t0\", \"629\\tTRUMP\\tI'll be very proud to.\\t0\", \"630\\tTRUMP\\tThey're actually quite great.\\t0\", '631\\tRADDATZ\\tThank you, Mr. Trump.\\t0', '632\\tCOOPER\\tWe want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes.\\t0', '633\\tCOOPER\\tWe have a question from Spencer Maass.\\t0', '634\\tCOOPER\\tSpencer?\\t0', '635\\tQUESTION\\tGood evening.\\t0', '636\\tQUESTION\\tMy question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?\\t0', '637\\tCOOPER\\tMr. Trump, you have two minutes.\\t0', \"638\\tTRUMP\\tWell, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.\\t0\", '639\\tTRUMP\\tOne of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.\\t0', '640\\tTRUMP\\tAnd she could have done this years ago, by the way.\\t0', \"641\\tTRUMP\\tShe's a United States -- she was a United States senator.\\t0\", '642\\tTRUMP\\tShe complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.\\t0', \"643\\tTRUMP\\tWell, why didn't she change it?\\t0\", \"644\\tTRUMP\\tWhy didn't you change it when you were a senator?\\t0\", \"645\\tTRUMP\\tThe reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.\\t0\", '646\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I do.\\t0', '647\\tTRUMP\\tYou have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.\\t0', \"648\\tTRUMP\\tBut you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.\\t0\", '649\\tTRUMP\\tBut -- and I say that about a lot of things.\\t0', \"650\\tTRUMP\\tYou know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.\\t0\", '651\\tTRUMP\\tI wish you would have done this.\\t0', \"652\\tTRUMP\\tBut she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.\\t0\", '653\\tTRUMP\\tShe never changed.\\t0', '654\\tTRUMP\\tAnd she never will change.\\t0', '655\\tTRUMP\\tShe never will change.\\t0', \"656\\tTRUMP\\tWe're getting rid of carried interest provisions.\\t0\", \"657\\tTRUMP\\tI'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.\\t0\", \"658\\tTRUMP\\tWe're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.\\t0\", \"659\\tTRUMP\\tBut we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.\\t0\", \"660\\tTRUMP\\tWe're cutting taxes for the middle class.\\t0\", '661\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.\\t0', '662\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.\\t1', '663\\tTRUMP\\tYou can look at me.\\t0', \"664\\tTRUMP\\tShe's raising your taxes really high.\\t1\", \"665\\tTRUMP\\tAnd what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.\\t0\", \"666\\tTRUMP\\tBut she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.\\t1\", '667\\tTRUMP\\tThat in itself is a big difference.\\t0', '668\\tTRUMP\\tWe are going to be thriving again.\\t0', '669\\tTRUMP\\tWe have no growth in this country.\\t0', \"670\\tTRUMP\\tThere's no growth.\\t0\", \"671\\tTRUMP\\tIf China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.\\t0\", \"672\\tTRUMP\\tWe're down at 1 percent.\\t0\", \"673\\tTRUMP\\tAnd that's, like, no growth.\\t0\", \"674\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we're going lower, in my opinion.\\t0\", '675\\tTRUMP\\tAnd a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.\\t0', \"676\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.\\t0\", \"677\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.\\t0\", \"678\\tTRUMP\\tBut she is raising everybody's taxes massively.\\t1\", '679\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\\t0', '680\\tCOOPER\\tThe question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?\\t0', \"681\\tCLINTON\\tWell, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.\\t0\", \"682\\tCLINTON\\tI'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.\\t0\", \"683\\tCLINTON\\tAnd it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.\\t0\", \"684\\tCLINTON\\tBut I'll tell you what he's going to do.\\t0\", \"685\\tCLINTON\\tHis plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.\\t0\", '686\\tCLINTON\\tDonald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.\\t0', '687\\tCLINTON\\tAnd, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.\\t1', \"688\\tCLINTON\\tNow, here's what I want to do.\\t0\", \"689\\tCLINTON\\tI have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.\\t0\", '690\\tCLINTON\\tAnd the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.\\t0', '691\\tCLINTON\\tAnd, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.\\t0', '692\\tCLINTON\\tI voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.\\t0', '693\\tCLINTON\\tI want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.\\t0', \"694\\tCLINTON\\tIt's called the Buffett rule.\\t0\", \"695\\tCLINTON\\tYes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.\\t0\", '696\\tCLINTON\\tI want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.\\t0', '697\\tCLINTON\\tWe have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.\\t0', '698\\tCLINTON\\tI want to invest in hard-working families.\\t0', \"699\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.\\t1\", '700\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we need to reverse that.\\t0', '701\\tCLINTON\\tPeople like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.\\t0', '702\\tCOOPER\\tThank you, Secretary.\\t0', \"703\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.\\t0\", '704\\tCOOPER\\tThank you.\\t0', '705\\tCOOPER\\tI want to give you -- Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond.\\t0', \"706\\tCOOPER\\tI just wanted to tell our viewers what she's referring to.\\t0\", '707\\tCOOPER\\tIn the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign.\\t0', '708\\tCOOPER\\tThe New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns.\\t0', '709\\tCOOPER\\tThey show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years.\\t0', \"710\\tCOOPER\\tYou've said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes.\\t0\", '711\\tCOOPER\\tYou have not answered, though, a simple question.\\t0', '712\\tCOOPER\\tDid you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?\\t0', '713\\tTRUMP\\tOf course I do.\\t0', '714\\tTRUMP\\tOf course I do.\\t0', '715\\tTRUMP\\tAnd so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.\\t0', '716\\tTRUMP\\tI know many of her donors.\\t0', '717\\tTRUMP\\tHer donors took massive tax write-offs.\\t0', '718\\tCOOPER\\tSo have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?\\t0', '719\\tTRUMP\\tA lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.\\t0', \"720\\tTRUMP\\tAnd she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.\\t0\", \"721\\tTRUMP\\tThat's why.\\t0\", \"722\\tTRUMP\\tSee, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.\\t0\", \"723\\tTRUMP\\tHillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.\\t0\", \"724\\tTRUMP\\tBut they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.\\t0\", \"725\\tTRUMP\\tVery interesting why she's leaving carried interest.\\t0\", '726\\tTRUMP\\tBut I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.\\t0', '727\\tTRUMP\\tI absolutely used it.\\t0', '728\\tTRUMP\\tAnd so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.\\t0', \"729\\tTRUMP\\tNow, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.\\t0\", \"730\\tTRUMP\\tSo we won't make them famous.\\t0\", '731\\tCOOPER\\tSo can you -- can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?\\t0', '732\\tTRUMP\\tNo, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.\\t0', \"733\\tTRUMP\\tBut I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.\\t0\", '734\\tTRUMP\\tI love depreciation.\\t0', \"735\\tTRUMP\\tYou know, she's given it to us.\\t0\", \"736\\tTRUMP\\tHey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.\\t0\", '737\\tTRUMP\\tI say it all the time.\\t0', '738\\tTRUMP\\tShe talks about health care.\\t0', \"739\\tTRUMP\\tWhy didn't she do something about it?\\t0\", '740\\tTRUMP\\tShe talks about taxes.\\t0', \"741\\tTRUMP\\tWhy didn't she do something about it?\\t0\", \"742\\tTRUMP\\tShe doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.\\t0\", \"743\\tTRUMP\\tWith her, it's all talk and no action.\\t0\", '744\\tCOOPER\\tIn the past...\\t0', \"745\\tTRUMP\\tAnd, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.\\t0\", '746\\tTRUMP\\tShe has made bad judgment not only on taxes.\\t0', \"747\\tTRUMP\\tShe's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.\\t0\", \"748\\tTRUMP\\tI mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.\\t1\", \"749\\tTRUMP\\tThey started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.\\t0\", '750\\tTRUMP\\tCongratulations.\\t0', '751\\tTRUMP\\tGreat job.\\t0', '752\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary -- I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.\\t0', '753\\tCLINTON\\tWell, here we go again.\\t0', \"754\\tCLINTON\\tI've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.\\t0\", \"755\\tCLINTON\\tBut that's not the point here.\\t0\", \"756\\tTRUMP\\tWhy didn't you do it?\\t0\", \"757\\tTRUMP\\tWhy didn't you do it?\\t0\", '758\\tCOOPER\\tAllow her to respond.\\t0', '759\\tCLINTON\\tBecause I was a senator with a Republican president.\\t0', '760\\tTRUMP\\tOh, really?\\t0', '761\\tCLINTON\\tI will be the president and we will get it done.\\t0', \"762\\tCLINTON\\tThat's exactly right.\\t0\", '763\\tTRUMP\\tYou could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.\\t0', '764\\tTRUMP\\tIf you were an effective senator, you could have done it.\\t0', '765\\tTRUMP\\tBut you were not an effective senator.\\t0', '766\\tCOOPER\\tPlease allow her to respond.\\t0', \"767\\tCOOPER\\tShe didn't interrupt you.\\t0\", '768\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.\\t0', '769\\tCLINTON\\tLook, he has now said repeatedly, \"30 years this and 30 years that.\"\\t0', '770\\tCLINTON\\tSo let me talk about my 30 years in public service.\\t0', \"771\\tCLINTON\\tI'm very glad to do so.\\t0\", \"772\\tCLINTON\\tEight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.\\t0\", '773\\tCLINTON\\tHundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.\\t0', '774\\tCLINTON\\tAfter 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.\\t0', '775\\tCLINTON\\tHundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.\\t0', \"776\\tCLINTON\\tWhen I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.\\t0\", '777\\tCLINTON\\tFour hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.\\t0', '778\\tCLINTON\\tI worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.\\t0', '779\\tCLINTON\\tAnd as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.\\t0', '780\\tCOOPER\\tThank you, secretary.\\t0', \"781\\tCLINTON\\tI've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.\\t0\", '782\\tCOOPER\\tThank you, secretary.\\t0', \"783\\tRADDATZ\\tWe're going to move on to Syria.\\t0\", '784\\tRADDATZ\\tBoth of you have mentioned that.\\t0', '785\\tTRUMP\\tShe said a lot of things that were false.\\t0', '786\\tTRUMP\\tI mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...\\t0', \"787\\tRADDATZ\\tNo, we can -- no, Mr. Trump, we're going to go on.\\t0\", '788\\tRADDATZ\\tThis is about the audience.\\t0', '789\\tTRUMP\\tExcuse me.\\t0', '790\\tTRUMP\\tBecause she has been a disaster as a senator.\\t0', '791\\tTRUMP\\tA disaster.\\t0', \"792\\tRADDATZ\\tMr. Trump, we're going to move on.\\t0\", \"793\\tRADDATZ\\tThe heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.\\t0\", '794\\tRADDATZ\\tBut there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children.\\t0', '795\\tRADDATZ\\tJust days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.\\t0', '796\\tRADDATZ\\tSo this next question comes through social media through Facebook.\\t0', '797\\tRADDATZ\\tDiane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?\\t0', \"798\\tRADDATZ\\tIsn't it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped?\\t0\", '799\\tRADDATZ\\tSecretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.\\t0', '800\\tCLINTON\\tWell, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.\\t0', '801\\tCLINTON\\tAnd every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.\\t0', '802\\tCLINTON\\tAnd there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.\\t0', \"803\\tCLINTON\\tRussia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.\\t0\", \"804\\tCLINTON\\tThey're interested in keeping Assad in power.\\t0\", '805\\tCLINTON\\tSo I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.\\t0', '806\\tCLINTON\\tWe need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.\\t0', '807\\tCLINTON\\tAnd we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.\\t0', '808\\tCLINTON\\tBut I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.\\t0', \"809\\tCLINTON\\tRussia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.\\t0\", \"810\\tCLINTON\\tAnd they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.\\t0\", \"811\\tCLINTON\\tI've stood up to Russia.\\t0\", \"812\\tCLINTON\\tI've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.\\t0\", \"813\\tCLINTON\\tI think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.\\t0\", '814\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I did as secretary of state.\\t0', \"815\\tCLINTON\\tThat's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.\\t1\", \"816\\tCLINTON\\tIt's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.\\t0\", '817\\tCLINTON\\tSo I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.\\t0', '818\\tCLINTON\\tBut I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.\\t0', '819\\tRADDATZ\\tThank you, Secretary Clinton.\\t0', '820\\tRADDATZ\\tMr. Trump?\\t0', '821\\tTRUMP\\tFirst of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...\\t0', \"822\\tCLINTON\\tNo, I wasn't.\\t0\", '823\\tCLINTON\\tI was gone.\\t0', '824\\tCLINTON\\tI hate to interrupt you, but at some point...\\t0', '825\\tTRUMP\\tOK.\\t0', '826\\tTRUMP\\tBut you were in contact -- excuse me.\\t0', '827\\tTRUMP\\tYou were...\\t0', '828\\tCLINTON\\tAt some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.\\t0', '829\\tTRUMP\\tYou were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.\\t0', \"830\\tTRUMP\\tI don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.\\t0\", '831\\tTRUMP\\tObama draws the line in the sand.\\t0', '832\\tTRUMP\\tIt was laughed at all over the world what happened.\\t0', '833\\tTRUMP\\tNow, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.\\t0', \"834\\tTRUMP\\tBut our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.\\t0\", '835\\tTRUMP\\tNot good.\\t0', \"836\\tTRUMP\\tOur government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.\\t0\", '837\\tTRUMP\\tRussia is new in terms of nuclear.\\t0', '838\\tTRUMP\\tWe are old.\\t0', \"839\\tTRUMP\\tWe're tired.\\t0\", \"840\\tTRUMP\\tWe're exhausted in terms of nuclear.\\t0\", '841\\tTRUMP\\tA very bad thing.\\t0', '842\\tTRUMP\\tNow, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.\\t0', '843\\tTRUMP\\tShe talks in favor of the rebels.\\t0', \"844\\tTRUMP\\tShe doesn't even know who the rebels are.\\t0\", \"845\\tTRUMP\\tYou know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.\\t0\", '846\\tTRUMP\\tAnd you know what happens?\\t0', '847\\tTRUMP\\tThey end up being worse than the people.\\t0', '848\\tTRUMP\\tLook at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.\\t0', \"849\\tTRUMP\\tGadhafi's out.\\t0\", \"850\\tTRUMP\\tIt's a mess.\\t0\", '851\\tTRUMP\\tAnd, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.\\t1', \"852\\tTRUMP\\tI'm sure you probably have heard that.\\t0\", '853\\tTRUMP\\tIt was a disaster.\\t0', \"854\\tTRUMP\\tBecause the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.\\t0\", \"855\\tTRUMP\\tBut if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.\\t0\", '856\\tTRUMP\\tWe sign a peace treaty.\\t0', \"857\\tTRUMP\\tEveryone's all excited.\\t0\", \"858\\tTRUMP\\tWell, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.\\t0\", '859\\tTRUMP\\tBut look at that deal.\\t0', '860\\tTRUMP\\tIran now and Russia are now against us.\\t0', '861\\tTRUMP\\tSo she wants to fight.\\t0', '862\\tTRUMP\\tShe wants to fight for rebels.\\t0', \"863\\tTRUMP\\tThere's only one problem.\\t0\", \"864\\tTRUMP\\tYou don't even know who the rebels are.\\t0\", \"865\\tTRUMP\\tSo what's the purpose?\\t0\", '866\\tRADDATZ\\tMr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.\\t0', '867\\tTRUMP\\tAnd one thing I have to say.\\t0', '868\\tRADDATZ\\tYour two minutes is up.\\t0', \"869\\tTRUMP\\tI don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.\\t0\", '870\\tTRUMP\\tRussia is killing ISIS.\\t0', '871\\tTRUMP\\tAnd Iran is killing ISIS.\\t0', '872\\tTRUMP\\tAnd those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.\\t0', '873\\tRADDATZ\\tMr. Trump, let me repeat the question.\\t0', '874\\tRADDATZ\\tIf you were president...\\t0', '875\\tSYSTEM\\t(LAUGHTER)\\t0', '876\\tRADDATZ\\twhat would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?\\t0', '877\\tRADDATZ\\tAnd I want to remind you what your running mate said.\\t0', '878\\tRADDATZ\\tHe said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.\\t0', '879\\tTRUMP\\tOK.\\t0', \"880\\tTRUMP\\tHe and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.\\t0\", '881\\tTRUMP\\tI disagree.\\t0', '882\\tRADDATZ\\tYou disagree with your running mate?\\t0', '883\\tTRUMP\\tI think you have to knock out ISIS.\\t0', '884\\tTRUMP\\tRight now, Syria is fighting ISIS.\\t0', '885\\tTRUMP\\tWe have people that want to fight both at the same time.\\t0', '886\\tTRUMP\\tBut Syria is no longer Syria.\\t0', \"887\\tTRUMP\\tSyria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.\\t0\", '888\\tTRUMP\\tI believe we have to get ISIS.\\t0', '889\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.\\t0', '890\\tTRUMP\\tShe had a chance to do something with Syria.\\t0', '891\\tTRUMP\\tThey had a chance.\\t0', '892\\tTRUMP\\tAnd that was the line.\\t0', \"893\\tTRUMP\\tAnd she didn't.\\t0\", '894\\tRADDATZ\\tWhat do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?\\t0', '895\\tTRUMP\\tI think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.\\t0', '896\\tRADDATZ\\tWhat do you think will happen if it falls?\\t0', '897\\tTRUMP\\tI think that it basically has fallen.\\t0', '898\\tTRUMP\\tOK?\\t0', '899\\tTRUMP\\tIt basically has fallen.\\t0', '900\\tTRUMP\\tLet me tell you something.\\t0', '901\\tTRUMP\\tYou take a look at Mosul.\\t0', '902\\tTRUMP\\tThe biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.\\t0', '903\\tTRUMP\\tThey think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.\\t0', '904\\tTRUMP\\tSo we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.\\t0', '905\\tTRUMP\\tWell, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.\\t0', \"906\\tTRUMP\\tWhy can't they do it quietly?\\t0\", \"907\\tTRUMP\\tWhy can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?\\t0\", '908\\tTRUMP\\tPeople leave.\\t0', \"909\\tTRUMP\\tWhy do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?\\t0\", '910\\tTRUMP\\tHow stupid is our country?\\t0', '911\\tRADDATZ\\tThere are sometimes reasons the military does that.\\t0', '912\\tRADDATZ\\tPsychological warfare.\\t0', \"913\\tTRUMP\\tI can't think of any.\\t0\", \"914\\tTRUMP\\tI can't think of any.\\t0\", \"915\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I'm pretty good at it.\\t0\", '916\\tRADDATZ\\tIt might be to help get civilians out.\\t0', '917\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we have General Flynn.\\t0', '918\\tTRUMP\\tAnd we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.\\t0', '919\\tTRUMP\\tI have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.\\t0', '920\\tTRUMP\\tWe talk about it all the time.\\t0', \"921\\tTRUMP\\tThey understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?\\t0\", '922\\tTRUMP\\tHow -- why would these people stay there?\\t0', \"923\\tTRUMP\\tI've been reading now...\\t0\", '924\\tRADDATZ\\tTell me what your strategy is.\\t0', \"925\\tTRUMP\\tfor weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.\\t0\", \"926\\tTRUMP\\tWhy would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.\\t0\", \"927\\tTRUMP\\tThey're gone.\\t0\", \"928\\tTRUMP\\tBecause everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.\\t0\", \"929\\tTRUMP\\tNow, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.\\t0\", '930\\tTRUMP\\tAll I say is this.\\t0', \"931\\tTRUMP\\tGeneral George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.\\t0\", \"932\\tRADDATZ\\tI'm going to go to Secretary Clinton.\\t0\", '933\\tRADDATZ\\tSecretary Clinton, you want Assad to go.\\t0', '934\\tRADDATZ\\tYou advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo.\\t0', '935\\tRADDATZ\\tYou talk about diplomatic efforts.\\t0', '936\\tRADDATZ\\tThose have failed.\\t0', '937\\tRADDATZ\\tCease-fires have failed.\\t0', '938\\tRADDATZ\\tWould you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?\\t0', '939\\tCLINTON\\tI would not use American ground forces in Syria.\\t0', '940\\tCLINTON\\tI think that would be a very serious mistake.\\t0', \"941\\tCLINTON\\tI don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.\\t0\", \"942\\tCLINTON\\tI don't think that is a smart strategy.\\t0\", \"943\\tCLINTON\\tI do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...\\t0\", '944\\tRADDATZ\\tBut what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?\\t0', \"945\\tCLINTON\\tWell, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...\\t0\", '946\\tTRUMP\\tEverything.\\t0', '947\\tCLINTON\\tI hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.\\t0', '948\\tCLINTON\\tI do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.\\t0', '949\\tCLINTON\\tAnd, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.\\t0', \"950\\tCLINTON\\tNo, he doesn't.\\t0\", '951\\tCLINTON\\tThere are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.\\t0', '952\\tCLINTON\\tAnd that takes a lot of planning and preparation.\\t0', '953\\tCLINTON\\tI would go after Baghdadi.\\t0', '954\\tCLINTON\\tI would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.\\t0', '955\\tCLINTON\\tSo I think that could help.\\t0', '956\\tCLINTON\\tI would also consider arming the Kurds.\\t0', '957\\tCLINTON\\tThe Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.\\t0', \"958\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.\\t0\", '959\\tRADDATZ\\tThank you very much.\\t0', \"960\\tRADDATZ\\tWe're going to move on...\\t0\", \"961\\tTRUMP\\tYou know what's funny?\\t0\", \"962\\tTRUMP\\tShe went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.\\t0\", \"963\\tTRUMP\\tWhen I go one second over, it's like a big deal.\\t0\", '964\\tRADDATZ\\tYou had many answers.\\t0', \"965\\tTRUMP\\tIt's really -- it's really very interesting.\\t0\", \"966\\tCOOPER\\tWe've got a question over here from James Carter.\\t0\", '967\\tCOOPER\\tMr. Carter?\\t0', '968\\tQUESTION\\tMy question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?\\t0', '969\\tCOOPER\\tThat question begins for Mr. Trump.\\t0', '970\\tTRUMP\\tAbsolutely.\\t0', '971\\tTRUMP\\tI mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.\\t0', '972\\tTRUMP\\tI will be a president for all of our people.\\t0', \"973\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.\\t0\", '974\\tTRUMP\\tBecause NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.\\t1', '975\\tTRUMP\\tNot in this country.\\t0', '976\\tTRUMP\\tIt stripped us of manufacturing jobs.\\t1', '977\\tTRUMP\\tWe lost our jobs.\\t0', '978\\tTRUMP\\tWe lost our money.\\t0', '979\\tTRUMP\\tWe lost our plants.\\t0', '980\\tTRUMP\\tIt is a disaster.\\t0', \"981\\tTRUMP\\tAnd now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.\\t0\", '982\\tTRUMP\\tShe called it the gold standard.\\t0', \"983\\tTRUMP\\tAnd by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.\\t0\", '984\\tTRUMP\\tThey actually said that she lied.\\t0', '985\\tTRUMP\\tOK?\\t0', '986\\tTRUMP\\tAnd she lied.\\t0', \"987\\tTRUMP\\tBut she's lied about a lot of things.\\t0\", '988\\tTRUMP\\tI would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.\\t0', \"989\\tTRUMP\\tDevastating what's happening to our inner cities.\\t0\", \"990\\tTRUMP\\tShe's been talking about it for years.\\t0\", '991\\tTRUMP\\tAs usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.\\t0', \"992\\tTRUMP\\tShe doesn't get it done.\\t0\", '993\\tTRUMP\\tSame with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.\\t0', '994\\tTRUMP\\tThe same exact thing.\\t0', \"995\\tTRUMP\\tThey talk, they don't get it done.\\t0\", \"996\\tTRUMP\\tYou go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.\\t0\", '997\\tTRUMP\\tAfrican- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.\\t0', '998\\tTRUMP\\tThe education is a disaster.\\t0', '999\\tTRUMP\\tJobs are essentially nonexistent.\\t0', \"1000\\tTRUMP\\tI mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?\\t0\", \"1001\\tTRUMP\\tIt can't get any worse.\\t0\", \"1002\\tTRUMP\\tAnd she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.\\t0\", \"1003\\tTRUMP\\tNothing's going to ever happen.\\t0\", \"1004\\tTRUMP\\tLet me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.\\t0\", \"1005\\tTRUMP\\tIt's just going to be talk.\\t0\", '1006\\tTRUMP\\tAnd all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.\\t0', \"1007\\tTRUMP\\tShe's not doing any me favors.\\t0\", \"1008\\tTRUMP\\tBut by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.\\t0\", '1009\\tCOOPER\\tMr. Trump, thank you.\\t0', \"1010\\tTRUMP\\tBut I will tell you, she's all talk.\\t0\", \"1011\\tTRUMP\\tIt doesn't get done.\\t0\", '1012\\tTRUMP\\tAll you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.\\t0', '1013\\tTRUMP\\tTake a look at upstate New York.\\t0', '1014\\tCOOPER\\tYour two minutes is up.\\t0', '1015\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton, two minutes?\\t0', '1016\\tTRUMP\\tIt turned out to be a disaster.\\t0', '1017\\tCOOPER\\tYou have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\\t0', '1018\\tCLINTON\\tWell, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.\\t0', '1019\\tCLINTON\\tMr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.\\t0', \"1020\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, right out of law

of that.\\t0\", '1023\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.\\t0', '1024\\tCLINTON\\tI worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about.\\t0', '1025\\tCLINTON\\tI have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.\\t0', '1026\\tCLINTON\\tSo I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.\\t0', \"1027\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.\\t0\", '1028\\tCLINTON\\tThey write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.\\t0', '1029\\tCLINTON\\tShe adopted him from Ethiopia when he was

to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?\\t0', '1033\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, children listen to what is being said.\\t0', '1034\\tCLINTON\\tTo go back to the very, very first question.\\t0', \"1035\\tCLINTON\\tAnd there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.\\t0\", '1036\\tCLINTON\\tBullying is up.\\t0', '1037\\tCLINTON\\tA lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.\\t0', '1038\\tCLINTON\\tA lot of kids are expressing their concerns.\\t0', '1039\\tCLINTON\\tSo, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.\\t0', '1040\\tCOOPER\\tYour time, Secretary Clinton.\\t0', '1041\\tCLINTON\\tDemocrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.\\t0',

last month.\\t0', '1047\\tCOOPER\\tYou said that half of Donald Trump\\'s supporters are, quote, \"deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\"\\t0', '1048\\tCOOPER\\tYou later said you regretted saying half.\\t0', '1049\\tCOOPER\\tYou didn\\'t express regret for using the term \"deplorables.\"\\t0', \"1050\\tCOOPER\\tTo Mr. Carter's question, how can you unite a country if you've written off tens of millions of Americans?\\t0\", '1051\\tCLINTON\\tWell, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.\\t0', \"1052\\tCLINTON\\tIt's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.\\t0\", \"1053\\tCLINTON\\tAnd what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.\\t0\", \"1054\\tCLINTON\\tAnd so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.\\t0\", '1055\\tCLINTON\\tWe ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.\\t0', '1056\\tCLINTON\\tAnd he is supporting me 100 percent.\\t0', '1057\\tCOOPER\\tThank you.\\t0', '1058\\tCLINTON\\tBecause we talked about what we wanted to do.\\t0', '1059\\tCLINTON\\tWe might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...\\t0', '1060\\tCOOPER\\tThank you,

respond.\\t0', '1064\\tTRUMP\\tWe have a divided nation.\\t0', '1065\\tTRUMP\\tWe have a very divided nation.\\t0', '1066\\tTRUMP\\tYou look at Charlotte.\\t0', '1067\\tTRUMP\\tYou look at

when she said deplorables, she meant it.\\t0', \"1072\\tTRUMP\\tAnd when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.\\t0\", '1073\\tCOOPER\\tShe said some of them are irredeemable.\\t0', \"1074\\tTRUMP\\tShe's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.\\t0\", \"1075\\tTRUMP\\tAnd this

in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline.\\t0', '1078\\tCOOPER\\tYou said, if a leader doesn\\'t have it, quote, \"he or she won\\'t be one for very long.\"\\t0', '1079\\tCOOPER\\tIn the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape.\\t1', '1080\\tCOOPER\\tIs that the discipline of a good leader?\\t0', \"1081\\tTRUMP\\tNo, there wasn't check out a sex tape.\\t0\", '1082\\tTRUMP\\tIt was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.\\t0', '1083\\tCOOPER\\tYou mentioned sex tape.\\t0', \"1084\\tTRUMP\\tBy the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.\\t0\", \"1085\\tTRUMP\\tShe said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?\\t0\", '1086\\tTRUMP\\tGuess what?\\t0', \"1087\\tTRUMP\\tShe didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...\\t0\", '1088\\tCOOPER\\tThe question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?\\t0', '1089\\tTRUMP\\t600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.\\t0', \"1090\\tTRUMP\\tWell, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.\\t0\", \"1091\\tTRUMP\\tBut she said she'll be awake.\\t0\", \"1092\\tTRUMP\\tWho's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.\\t0\", '1093\\tTRUMP\\tGuess what happened?\\t0', '1094\\tTRUMP\\tAmbassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.\\t1', \"1095\\tTRUMP\\tAnd the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.\\t0\", \"1096\\tTRUMP\\tSo, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.\\t0\", '1097\\tTRUMP\\tNow, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.\\t0', '1098\\tTRUMP\\tI mean, you can like it or not like it.\\t0', '1099\\tTRUMP\\tI have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people.\\t0', \"1100\\tTRUMP\\tIt's a very effective way of communication.\\t0\", '1101\\tTRUMP\\tSo you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.\\t0', \"1102\\tTRUMP\\tI'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.\\t0\", '1103\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?\\t0', '1104\\tCLINTON\\tNo.\\t0', \"1105\\tTRUMP\\tI'm shocked to hear that.\\t0\", '1106\\tSYSTEM\\t(LAUGHTER)\\t0', \"1107\\tCLINTON\\tWell, it's not only my opinion.\\t0\", \"1108\\tCLINTON\\tIt's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.\\t0\", \"1109\\tCLINTON\\tBut it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.\\t0\", '1110\\tCLINTON\\tEverybody.\\t0', '1111\\tCLINTON\\tAfrican-American incomes went up 33 percent.\\t0', \"1112\\tCLINTON\\tAnd it's not just because I worked with George W.

Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.\\t0\", '1149\\tCLINTON\\tNow, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.\\t0', '1150\\tCLINTON\\tAnd among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.\\t0', '1151\\tCLINTON\\tI think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.\\t0', \"1152\\tCLINTON\\tI want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.\\t0\", \"1153\\tCLINTON\\tI want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.\\t0\", '1154\\tCLINTON\\tSo I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.\\t0', \"1155\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.\\t0\", '1156\\tCLINTON\\tI think that was a dereliction of duty.\\t0', '1157\\tCLINTON\\tI hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.\\t0', '1158\\tRADDATZ\\tThank you, Secretary Clinton.\\t0', '1159\\tRADDATZ\\tThank you.\\t0', \"1160\\tRADDATZ\\tYou're out of time.\\t0\", '1161\\tRADDATZ\\tMr. Trump?\\t0', '1162\\tTRUMP\\tJustice

everybody.\\t0\", '1166\\tTRUMP\\tBut people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.\\t0', '1167\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I think that this is so important.\\t0', '1168\\tTRUMP\\tAlso, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.\\t0', \"1169\\tTRUMP\\tThey'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.\\t0\", '1170\\tTRUMP\\tSo important to me.\\t0', '1171\\tTRUMP\\tNow, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.\\t0', \"1172\\tTRUMP\\tSo I will have in my race more than $100

\"1174\\tTRUMP\\tSo I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.\\t0\", '1175\\tTRUMP\\tPretty much self-funding money.\\t0',

$250 million by being in office.\\t0\", '1178\\tTRUMP\\tShe used the power of her office to make a lot of money.\\t0', \"1179\\tTRUMP\\tWhy isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?\\t0\", \"1180\\tTRUMP\\tIt's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.\\t0\", \"1181\\tTRUMP\\tWhy aren't you putting some money in?\\t0\", '1182\\tTRUMP\\tYou have a lot of it.\\t0', \"1183\\tTRUMP\\tYou've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.\\t0\", '1184\\tTRUMP\\tMade a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.\\t0', \"1185\\tTRUMP\\tSo why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?\\t0\", \"1186\\tTRUMP\\tI'm just curious.\\t0\", '1187\\tCLINTON\\tWell...\\t0', '1188\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '1189\\tRADDATZ\\tThank you very much.\\t0', \"1190\\tRADDATZ\\tWe're going to get on to one more question.\\t0\", '1191\\tCLINTON\\tThe question was about the Supreme Court.\\t0', '1192\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.\\t0', '1193\\tCLINTON\\tBut I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.\\t0', '1194\\tCOOPER\\tThank you.\\t0', '1195\\tRADDATZ\\tWe have -- we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.\\t0', '1196\\tCLINTON\\tWe have to save as many lives as we possibly can.\\t0', '1197\\tCOOPER\\tWe have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy.\\t0', '1198\\tCOOPER\\tKen?\\t0', '1199\\tQUESTION\\tWhat steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?\\t0', '1200\\tCOOPER\\tMr. Trump, two minutes?\\t0', '1201\\tTRUMP\\tAbsolutely.\\t0', \"1202\\tTRUMP\\tI think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.\\t0\", '1203\\tTRUMP\\tUnder absolutely siege.\\t0', '1204\\tTRUMP\\tThe EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.\\t0', '1205\\tTRUMP\\tAnd foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.\\t0', '1206\\tTRUMP\\tWe are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.\\t0', \"1207\\tTRUMP\\tNow, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.\\t0\", '1208\\tTRUMP\\tBut we need much more than wind and solar.\\t0', '1209\\tTRUMP\\tAnd you look at our miners.\\t0', '1210\\tTRUMP\\tHillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.\\t1', '1211\\tTRUMP\\tThere is a thing called clean coal.\\t0', '1212\\tTRUMP\\tCoal will last for 1,000 years in this country.\\t0', '1213\\tTRUMP\\tNow we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.\\t0', '1214\\tTRUMP\\tWe have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.\\t0', '1215\\tTRUMP\\tSo good.\\t0', '1216\\tTRUMP\\tEspecially when you have $20 trillion in debt.\\t0', '1217\\tTRUMP\\tI will bring our energy companies back.\\t0', \"1218\\tTRUMP\\tThey'll be able to compete.\\t0\", \"1219\\tTRUMP\\tThey'll make money.\\t0\", \"1220\\tTRUMP\\tThey'll pay off our national debt.\\t0\", \"1221\\tTRUMP\\tThey'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.\\t0\", '1222\\tTRUMP\\tBut we are putting our energy companies out of business.\\t0', '1223\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to bring back our workers.\\t0', \"1224\\tTRUMP\\tYou take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.\\t0\", '1225\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to guard our energy companies.\\t0', '1226\\tTRUMP\\tWe have to make it possible.\\t0', '1227\\tTRUMP\\tThe EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.\\t0', \"1228\\tTRUMP\\tAnd all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.\\t0\", \"1229\\tTRUMP\\tIt's a disgrace.\\t0\", '1230\\tCOOPER\\tYour time is up.\\t0', '1231\\tCOOPER\\tThank you.\\t0', \"1232\\tTRUMP\\tIt's an absolute disgrace.\\t0\", '1233\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton, two minutes.\\t0', '1234\\tCLINTON\\tAnd actually -- well, that was very interesting.\\t0', '1235\\tCLINTON\\tFirst of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.\\t0', \"1236\\tCLINTON\\tThat's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.\\t0\", \"1237\\tCLINTON\\tYou know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.\\t1\", '1238\\tCLINTON\\tWe are not dependent upon the Middle East.\\t0', '1239\\tCLINTON\\tBut the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.\\t0', '1240\\tCLINTON\\tSo the price of oil has been way down.\\t0', '1241\\tCLINTON\\tAnd that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?\\t0', '1242\\tCLINTON\\tWe are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.\\t0', \"1243\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think that's an important transition.\\t0\", \"1244\\tCLINTON\\tWe've got to remain energy-independent.\\t0\", '1245\\tCLINTON\\tIt gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.\\t0', '1246\\tCLINTON\\tWe have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.\\t0', '1247\\tCLINTON\\tSo I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.\\t0', '1248\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.\\t0', \"1249\\tCLINTON\\tBut I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.\\t0\", \"1250\\tCLINTON\\tThat's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.\\t0\", '1251\\tCLINTON\\tA lot of them lost their lives.\\t0', '1252\\tCLINTON\\tThey were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.\\t0', \"1253\\tCLINTON\\tI don't want to walk away from them.\\t0\", \"1254\\tCLINTON\\tSo we've got to do something for them.\\t0\", '1255\\tCOOPER\\tSecretary Clinton...\\t0', '1256\\tCLINTON\\tBut the price of coal is down worldwide.\\t0', '1257\\tCLINTON\\tSo we have to look at this comprehensively.\\t0', '1258\\tCOOPER\\tYour time is up.\\t0', \"1259\\tCLINTON\\tAnd that's exactly what I have proposed.\\t0\", '1260\\tCLINTON\\tI hope you will go to

you like to go first?\\t0', \"1270\\tCLINTON\\tWell, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.\\t0\", '1271\\tCLINTON\\tLook, I respect his children.\\t0', '1272\\tCLINTON\\tHis children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.\\t0', \"1273\\tCLINTON\\tI don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.\\t0\", '1274\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.\\t0', \"1275\\tCLINTON\\tSo I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.\\t0\", '1276\\tCLINTON\\tThis is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.\\t0', '1277\\tCLINTON\\tWe are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.\\t0', \"1278\\tCLINTON\\tIt's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.\\t0\", \"1279\\tCLINTON\\tAnd that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.\\t0\", \"1280\\tCLINTON\\tAnd that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.\\t0\", '1281\\tCLINTON\\tAnd I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.\\t0', '1282\\tRADDATZ\\tMr. Trump?\\t0', '1283\\tTRUMP\\tWell, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.\\t0', \"1284\\tTRUMP\\tI don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.\\t0\", \"1285\\tTRUMP\\tAnd they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.\\t0\", '1286\\tTRUMP\\tSo I consider that a compliment.\\t0', '1287\\tTRUMP\\tI will say this about Hillary.\\t0', \"1288\\tTRUMP\\tShe doesn't quit.\\t0\",

much of what she's fighting for.\\t0\", '1294\\tTRUMP\\tI do disagree with her judgment in many cases.\\t0', \"1295\\tTRUMP\\tBut she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.\\t0\", '1296\\tTRUMP\\tAnd I consider that to be a very good trait.\\t0', '1297\\tRADDATZ\\tThanks to both of you.\\t0', '1298\\tCOOPER\\tWe want to thank both the candidates.\\t0',

'1303\\tRADDATZ\\tGood night, everyone.\\t0', '1\\tQUIJANO\\tGood evening.\\t0', '2\\tQUIJANO\\tFrom Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\\t0', \"3\\tQUIJANO\\tI'm Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News.\\t0\", \"4\\tQUIJANO\\tIt's an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence.\\t0\", '5\\tQUIJANO\\tBoth are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines.\\t0', '6\\tQUIJANO\\tThe campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate.\\t0', '7\\tQUIJANO\\tThere will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues.\\t0', '8\\tQUIJANO\\tEach segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer.\\t0', \"9\\tQUIJANO\\tThen I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates.\\t0\", \"10\\tQUIJANO\\tBy coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question.\\t0\", '11\\tQUIJANO\\tWe have an enthusiastic audience tonight.\\t0', \"12\\tQUIJANO\\tThey've agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine.\\t0\", '13\\tSYSTEM\\t(APPLAUSE)\\t0', '14\\tQUIJANO\\tGentlemen, welcome.\\t0', '15\\tQUIJANO\\tIt truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.\\t0', \"16\\tQUIJANO\\tI'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership.\\t0\", '17\\tQUIJANO\\tTwenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world.\\t0', \"18\\tQUIJANO\\tWhat about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice?\\t0\", '19\\tQUIJANO\\tSenator Kaine?\\t0', '20\\tKAINE\\tElaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome.\\t0', '21\\tKAINE\\tIt is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.\\t0', '22\\tKAINE\\tThis is a very special place.\\t0', '23\\tKAINE\\tSixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School.\\t0', '24\\tKAINE\\tShe made history by protesting school segregation.\\t0', '25\\tKAINE\\tShe believed our nation was stronger together.\\t0', '26\\tKAINE\\tAnd that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.\\t0', '27\\tKAINE\\tI am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States.\\t0', \"28\\tKAINE\\tI'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago.\\t0\", \"29\\tKAINE\\tThat's why I'm so proud to be her running mate.\\t0\", '30\\tKAINE\\tHillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate.\\t0', '31\\tKAINE\\tShe said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill.\\t0', \"32\\tKAINE\\tIt'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results.\\t0\", \"33\\tKAINE\\tAnd she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer.\\t0\", \"34\\tKAINE\\tYou've been a city councilman and mayor.\\t0\", \"35\\tKAINE\\tYou've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator.\\t0\", \"36\\tKAINE\\tI think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives.\\t0\", \"37\\tKAINE\\tAnd that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government.\\t0\", \"38\\tKAINE\\tBut my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible.\\t0\", '39\\tKAINE\\tAnd I relish that role.\\t0', \"40\\tKAINE\\tI'm so proud of her.\\t0\", \"41\\tKAINE\\tI'll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life.\\t0\", '42\\tKAINE\\tWe have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now.\\t0', '43\\tKAINE\\tWe trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death.\\t0', '44\\tQUIJANO\\tGovernor Pence?\\t0', '45\\tPENCE\\tWell, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates.\\t0', \"46\\tPENCE\\tIt's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family.\\t0\", \"47\\tPENCE\\tAnd, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well.\\t0\", \"48\\tPENCE\\tAnd I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation.\\t0\", \"49\\tPENCE\\tFor the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened.\\t0\", \"50\\tPENCE\\tWe've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change.\\t0\", '51\\tPENCE\\tAnd so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight.\\t0', '52\\tPENCE\\tI also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket.\\t0', \"53\\tPENCE\\tI have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville.\\t0\", '54\\tPENCE\\tI grew up with a cornfield in my backyard.\\t0', \"55\\tPENCE\\tMy grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age.\\t0\", '56\\tPENCE\\tMy mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana.\\t0', '57\\tPENCE\\tThey built a family and -- and a good name and a business.\\t0', '58\\tPENCE\\tAnd they raised a family.\\t0', \"59\\tPENCE\\tAnd I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position.\\t0\", \"60\\tPENCE\\tSo to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States.\\t0\", \"61\\tPENCE\\tAnd that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience.\\t0\", \"62\\tQUIJANO\\tSenator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy.\\t0\", '63\\tQUIJANO\\tWhy do so many people distrust her?\\t0', '64\\tQUIJANO\\tIs it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?\\t0', '65\\tKAINE\\tElaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton.\\t0', \"66\\tKAINE\\tHere's what people should look at as they look at a public servant.\\t0\", '67\\tKAINE\\tDo they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life?\\t0', '68\\tKAINE\\tAnd have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing?\\t0', '69\\tKAINE\\tHillary Clinton has that passion.\\t0', '70\\tKAINE\\tFrom a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids.\\t0', \"71\\tKAINE\\tAs a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first.\\t0\", \"72\\tKAINE\\tAnd that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.\\t0\", '73\\tKAINE\\tDonald Trump always puts himself first.\\t0', '74\\tKAINE\\tHe built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, \"off the backs of the little guy.\"\\t0', \"75\\tKAINE\\tAnd as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States.\\t0\", '76\\tKAINE\\tIt is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States.\\t0', '77\\tKAINE\\tAnd I can\\'t imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish \"me first\" style of Donald Trump.\\t0', '78\\tQUIJANO\\tGovernor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, \"thoughtful, compassionate, and steady.\"\\t0', '79\\tQUIJANO\\tYet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president.\\t0', '80\\tQUIJANO\\tWhy do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?\\t0', '81\\tPENCE\\tWell, let me -- let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign.\\t0', '82\\tPENCE\\tIt really is remarkable.\\t0', \"83\\tPENCE\\tAt a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control.\\t0\", \"84\\tPENCE\\tI mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create.\\t0\", \"85\\tPENCE\\tThe newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach...\\t0\", '86\\tKAINE\\tYou guys love Russia.\\t0', '87\\tKAINE\\tYou both have said...\\t0', '88\\tPENCE\\ttheir heavy-handed approach.\\t0', '89\\tKAINE\\tYou both have said -- you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.\\t0', '90\\tPENCE\\tWell...\\t0', '91\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', \"92\\tQUIJANO\\tWell, we're going to get to Russia in just a moment.\\t0\", '93\\tQUIJANO\\tBut I do want to get back to the question at...\\t0', '94\\tPENCE\\tBut in the midst -- Elaine, thank you.\\t0', '95\\tPENCE\\tThank you.\\t0', \"96\\tPENCE\\tThank you, Senator, I'll...\\t0\", '97\\tKAINE\\tThese guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader.\\t0', '98\\tKAINE\\tHow can that...\\t0', '99\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '100\\tQUIJANO\\tYes, and we will get to that, Senator.\\t0', '101\\tQUIJANO\\tWe do have that coming up here.\\t0', '102\\tQUIJANO\\tBut in the meantime, the questions...\\t0', '103\\tPENCE\\tWell, Senator, I must have hit a...\\t0', '104\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '105\\tPENCE\\tI must have hit a nerve here.\\t0', '106\\tQUIJANO\\tWhy the disconnect?\\t0', \"107\\tPENCE\\tBecause at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults.\\t0\", '108\\tPENCE\\tLook, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times.\\t0', \"109\\tPENCE\\tHe's brought an extraordinary business acumen.\\t0\", \"110\\tPENCE\\tHe's employed tens of thousands of people in this country.\\t0\", '111\\tKAINE\\tAnd paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.\\t0', '112\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '113\\tQUIJANO\\tAnd why the disconnect with your running mate?\\t0', \"114\\tPENCE\\tBut there's a -- there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton.\\t0\", \"115\\tPENCE\\tAnd that's because they're paying attention.\\t0\", '116\\tPENCE\\tI mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on.\\t0', '117\\tPENCE\\tShe had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.\\t0', \"118\\tKAINE\\tYou are Donald Trump's apprentice.\\t0\", '119\\tKAINE\\tLet me talk about this...\\t0', '120\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', \"121\\tPENCE\\tSenator, I think I'm still on my time.\\t0\", \"122\\tKAINE\\tWell, I think -- isn't this a discussion?\\t0\", '123\\tQUIJANO\\tThis is our open discussion.\\t0', \"124\\tKAINE\\tYeah, let's talk about the state of...\\t0\", '125\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '126\\tPENCE\\tWell, let me interrupt -- let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can.\\t0', '127\\tKAINE\\tFinish your sentence.\\t0', '128\\tPENCE\\tThe Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state.\\t0', '129\\tKAINE\\tOK, now I can weigh in.\\t0', '130\\tKAINE\\tNow...\\t0', '131\\tPENCE\\tShe had a private server...\\t0', '132\\tKAINE\\tNow, I get to weigh in.\\t0', '133\\tKAINE\\tNow, let me just say this...\\t0', '134\\tPENCE\\tthat was discovered...\\t0', '135\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '136\\tQUIJANO\\tSenator, you have an opportunity to respond.\\t0', '137\\tPENCE\\tkeep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public.\\t0', \"138\\tKAINE\\tGovernor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault.\\t0\", '139\\tPENCE\\tDo you?\\t0', '140\\tKAINE\\tLet me tell you this.\\t0', '141\\tKAINE\\tWhen Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?\\t0', '142\\tPENCE\\tYes.\\t0', '143\\tKAINE\\tDo you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan?\\t0', '144\\tKAINE\\tDo you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?\\t0', \"145\\tKAINE\\tUnder Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth.\\t0\", '146\\tKAINE\\tShe worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile.\\t1', '147\\tKAINE\\tShe worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.\\t1', '148\\tPENCE\\tEliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?\\t0', '149\\tKAINE\\tAbsolutely, without firing a shot.\\t0', '150\\tKAINE\\tAnd instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000.\\t0', '151\\tPENCE\\tRight and...\\t0', '152\\tKAINE\\tThese are very, very good things.\\t0', '153\\tPENCE\\tAnd Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate...\\t0', '154\\tKAINE\\tWell, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that.\\t0', '155\\tPENCE\\tHillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement...\\t0', '156\\tKAINE\\tNo, that is incorrect.\\t0', \"157\\tKAINE\\tThat's incorrect.\\t0\", '158\\tPENCE\\tAnd so we removed -- we removed all of our...\\t0', \"159\\tQUIJANO\\tGentlemen, we'll get to...\\t0\", '160\\tSYSTEM\\t(CROSSTALK)\\t0', '161\\tPENCE\\ttroops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum.\\t0', \"162\\tKAINE\\tBut I'd like to correct...\\t0\", '163\\tPENCE\\tand overrun vast areas of Iraq.\\t0', '164\\tKAINE\\tGovernor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011.\\t1', \"165\\tKAINE\\tAnd, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops.\\t1\", '166\\tKAINE\\tAnd guess what?\\t0', \"167\\tKAINE\\tIf a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection.\\t0\", '168\\tPENCE\\tIt was a failure of the secretary of state...\\t0', '169\\tQUIJANO\\tWe need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen.\\t0', \"170\\tKAINE\\tIf Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's...\\t0\", '171\\tQUIJANO\\tThere are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy.\\t0', \"172\\tQUIJANO\\tLet's turn to the issue of the economy.\\t0\", '173\\tKAINE\\tOK.\\t0', '174\\tQUIJANO\\tAccording to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt.\\t0', '175\\tQUIJANO\\tIn fact, your plans would add even more to it.\\t0', '176\\tQUIJANO\\tBoth of you were governors who balanced state budgets.\\t0', '177\\tQUIJANO\\tAre you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country.\\t0', '178\\tQUIJANO\\tGovernor Pence?\\t0', \"179\\tPENCE\\tI think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.\\t0\", \"180\\tPENCE\\tI mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works.\\t0\", '181\\tPENCE\\tThe state of Indiana has balanced budgets.\\t1', \"182\\tPENCE\\tWe cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank.\\t1\", \"183\\tPENCE\\tThat's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia.\\t0\", '184\\tPENCE\\tHe actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion.\\t0', '185\\tPENCE\\tHe left his state about $2 billion in the hole.\\t0', \"186\\tPENCE\\tIn the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.\\t1\", \"187\\tPENCE\\tBut I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.\\t0\", '188\\tPENCE\\tIt really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that.\\t0', '189\\tPENCE\\tYou tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful.\\t0', '190\\tPENCE\\tBut a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan.\\t0', '191\\tPENCE\\tBut Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare.\\t0', '192\\tPENCE\\tThey want to expand it into a single-payer program.\\t0', '193\\tPENCE\\tAnd for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.\\t0', '194\\tPENCE\\tLook, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.\\t0', '195\\tPENCE\\tWe can get America moving again.\\t0', \"196\\tPENCE\\tPut on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth.\\t0\", \"197\\tPENCE\\tAnd when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt.\\t0\", \"198\\tPENCE\\tWhen we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.\\t0\", '199\\tQUIJANO\\tSenator Kaine?\\t0', \"200\\tKAINE\\tElaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate.\\t0\", '201\\tKAINE\\tDo you want a \"you\\'re hired\" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a \"you\\'re fired\" president in Donald Trump?\\t0', \"202\\tKAINE\\tI think that's not such a hard choice.\\t0\", '203\\tKAINE\\tHillary and I have a plan that\\'s on the table that\\'s a \"you\\'re hired\" plan.\\t0', '204\\tKAINE\\tFive components.\\t0', '205\\tKAINE\\tFirst thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow.\\t0', '206\\tKAINE\\tSecond thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.\\t0', \"207\\tKAINE\\tThird, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.\\t0\", \"208\\tKAINE\\tFourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses.\\t0\", '209\\tKAINE\\tHillary and I each grew up in small-business families.\\t0', '210\\tKAINE\\tMy dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.\\t0', \"211\\tKAINE\\tAnd, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.\\t0\", '212\\tKAINE\\tThe Trump plan is a different plan.\\t0', '213\\tKAINE\\tIt\\'s a \"you\\'re fired\" plan.\\t0', \"214\\tKAINE\\tAnd there's two key elements to it.\\t0\", '215\\tKAINE\\tFirst, Donald Trump said wages are too high.\\t1', '216\\tKAINE\\tAnd both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.\\t0', '217\\tKAINE\\tMike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.\\t0', '218\\tKAINE\\tAnd he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.\\t0', '219\\tKAINE\\tThe second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.\\t0', \"220\\tKAINE\\tThe problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s.\\t0\", '221\\tKAINE\\tIndependent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.\\t1', '222\\tKAINE\\tThe Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.\\t1', '223\\tKAINE\\tAnd Donald Trump -- why would he do this?\\t0', '224\\tKAINE\\tBecause his tax plan basically helps him.\\t0', '225\\tKAINE\\tAnd if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.\\t0', \"226\\tQUIJANO\\tOn that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return

'374\\tKAINE\\tI think we put a lot on police shoulders.\\t0', '375\\tKAINE\\tAnd this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on.\\t0', '376\\tKAINE\\tI was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond.\\t0', '377\\tKAINE\\tAnd when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States.\\t0', '378\\tKAINE\\tWe fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half.\\t0', '379\\tKAINE\\tAnd then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too.\\t0', '380\\tKAINE\\tAnd we did something we had really wanted to do.\\t0', '381\\tKAINE\\tFor the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together.\\t0', \"382\\tKAINE\\tHere's what I learned as a mayor and a governor.\\t0\", '383\\tKAINE\\tThe way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing.\\t0', '384\\tKAINE\\tYou build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows.\\t0', \"385\\tKAINE\\tAnd when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police.\\t0\", \"386\\tKAINE\\tThat model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model.\\t0\", '387\\tKAINE\\tDonald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country.\\t0', '388\\tKAINE\\tThat would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.\\t0', \"389\\tKAINE\\tSo here's what we'll do.\\t0\", \"390\\tKAINE\\tWe'll focus on community policing.\\t0\", '391\\tKAINE\\tWe will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States.\\t0', \"392\\tKAINE\\tI'm a gun-owner.\\t0\", \"393\\tKAINE\\tI'm a strong Second Amendment supporter.\\t0\", \"394\\tKAINE\\tBut I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks.\\t0\", \"395\\tKAINE\\tAnd if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did.\\t0\", '396\\tKAINE\\tOne of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu.\\t0', '397\\tKAINE\\tHe was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust

at Virginia Tech, and he couldn't survive the scourge of gun violence.\\t0\", '401\\tKAINE\\tWe can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too.\\t0', '402\\tQUIJANO\\tGovernor Pence?\\t0', '403\\tPENCE\\tYou know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago.\\t0', '404\\tPENCE\\tHe was my

restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation.\\t0', \"413\\tPENCE\\tIt's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them.\\t0\", '414\\tPENCE\\tThey see his commitment to law and order.\\t0', '415\\tPENCE\\tBut they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism.\\t0', '416\\tPENCE\\tAnd that really has got to stop.\\t0', '417\\tPENCE\\tI mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy.\\t0', '418\\tPENCE\\tI mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn.\\t0', '419\\tPENCE\\tWe -- we grieve with those who grieve.\\t0', \"420\\tPENCE\\tAnd we're saddened at the loss of life.\\t0\", \"421\\tPENCE\\tBut Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States.\\t1\", '422\\tPENCE\\tI just think...\\t0', '423\\tKAINE\\tCan I -- can I explain...\\t0', '424\\tPENCE\\tI just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy.\\t0', \"425\\tPENCE\\tWe ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action.\\t0\", '426\\tPENCE\\tBut, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.\\t0', \"427\\tKAINE\\tElaine -- Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement.\\t0\", \"428\\tKAINE\\tAnd if you're afraid

-- here's an example, heartbreaking.\\t0\", '432\\tKAINE\\tWe would agree this was a heartbreaking example.\\t0', '433\\tKAINE\\tThe guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school.\\t0', '434\\tKAINE\\tAnd he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated.\\t0', '435\\tKAINE\\tBut when folks

him.\\t0', '437\\tKAINE\\tBut he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident.\\t0', '438\\tKAINE\\tAnd if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos

ISIS.\\t0', \"670\\tPENCE\\tAnd because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard

immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism.\\t0', '688\\tQUIJANO\\tBut that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub

'815\\tPENCE\\tAfter the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea.\\t0', '816\\tPENCE\\tAnd the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States

marshals the forces and begins -- look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.\\t0', '817\\tPENCE\\tIt begins by rebuilding our military.\\t0', '818\\tPENCE\\tAnd the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military.\\t0', '819\\tPENCE\\tWe have the smallest Navy since 1916.\\t0', '820\\tPENCE\\tWe have the

provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength.\\t0', '824\\tPENCE\\tAnd if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians

that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts.\\t0\", \"1059\\tPENCE\\tThat's not an endorsement of Vladimir

'1063\\tKAINE\\tWell, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it.\\t0', '1064\\tKAINE\\tBut Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President

'1079\\tKAINE\\tThose could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them.\\t0', \"1080\\tKAINE\\tAmericans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's

got to -- we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways.\\t0\", '1094\\tKAINE\\tThere are areas where we can cooperate.\\t0', '1095\\tKAINE\\tSo it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile.\\t0', '1096\\tKAINE\\tIt was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot.\\t0', \"1097\\tKAINE\\tShe's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy.\\t0\", '1098\\tKAINE\\tBut she knows how to sit down at a table and

recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test.\\t0', '1102\\tPENCE\\tRight.\\t0', '1103\\tQUIJANO\\tWhat specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States?\\t0', '1104\\tQUIJANO\\tGovernor Pence?\\t0', '1105\\tPENCE\\tWell, first, we need to -- we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces.\\t0', '1106\\tPENCE\\tAnd we also need -- we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions.\\t0', '1107\\tPENCE\\tIt has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple.\\t0', \"1108\\tPENCE\\tAnd when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that

\"1109\\tPENCE\\tWe're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength.\\t0\", '1110\\tPENCE\\tBut I have to tell you that -- that all this talk about tax returns -- and I get

in some focus group.\\t0', '1115\\tPENCE\\tBut here -- Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation.\\t0', '1116\\tPENCE\\tWhile she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors.\\t0', '1117\\tPENCE\\tNow, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff.\\t0', '1118\\tPENCE\\tForeign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process.\\t0', '1119\\tPENCE\\tThey cannot make financial contributions.\\t0', '1120\\tPENCE\\tBut the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars.\\t0', '1121\\tPENCE\\tAnd then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation.\\t0', '1122\\tPENCE\\tWhen you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason...\\t0', '1123\\tQUIJANO\\tGovernor, your two minutes are up.\\t0', \"1124\\tPENCE\\tthe reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server...\\t0\", '1125\\tQUIJANO\\tGovernor, please.\\t0', \"1126\\tPENCE\\twhile she's secretary of state.\\t0\", '1127\\tQUIJANO\\tYour two

I'll talk about North Korea.\\t0\", '1131\\tKAINE\\tSo, on the foundation.\\t0', '1132\\tKAINE\\tI am glad to talk about the foundation.\\t0', '1133\\tKAINE\\tThe Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world.\\t0', '1134\\tKAINE\\tIt provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people.\\t0', '1135\\tKAINE\\tIt helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses.\\t0', '1136\\tKAINE\\tIt gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does.\\t0', '1137\\tKAINE\\tThe Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work.\\t0', '1138\\tKAINE\\tHillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation.\\t0', '1139\\tKAINE\\tThe State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States.\\t0', '1140\\tKAINE\\tSo the foundation does good work.\\t0', '1141\\tKAINE\\tAnd Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States.\\t0', \"1142\\tKAINE\\tBut let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation.\\t0\", '1143\\tKAINE\\tThe Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns.\\t0', \"1144\\tKAINE\\tHe's refused to do it.\\t0\", '1145\\tKAINE\\tHis sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia.\\t0', '1146\\tKAINE\\tAnd remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit.\\t0', \"1147\\tKAINE\\tIt's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.\\t0\", '1148\\tPENCE\\tThe Trump Foundation is non-profit.\\t0', '1149\\tKAINE\\tIn addition, Donald Trump has a foundation.\\t0', '1150\\tKAINE\\tThe foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general.\\t0', '1151\\tKAINE\\tThey made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else.\\t0', '1152\\tKAINE\\tAnd the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University.\\t0', \"1153\\tKAINE\\tThis is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are.\\t0\", '1154\\tQUIJANO\\tGovernor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea.\\t0', '1155\\tSYSTEM\\t(LAUGHTER)\\t0', '1156\\tPENCE\\tWell, Thank you.\\t0', '1157\\tPENCE\\tThank you.\\t0', '1158\\tPENCE\\tThe Trump Foundation is a private family foundation.\\t0', '1159\\tPENCE\\tThey give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes.\\t0', '1160\\tKAINE\\tPolitical contributions?\\t0', '1161\\tPENCE\\tLess than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.\\t0', '1162\\tKAINE\\tA $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump?\\t0', '1163\\tPENCE\\tLess than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.\\t1', '1164\\tKAINE\\tNinety percent.\\t0', '1165\\tPENCE\\tIt has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff.\\t0', '1166\\tPENCE\\tBut honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails...\\t1', \"1167\\tQUIJANO\\tAll right, let's turn back to North Korea...\\t0\", '1168\\tPENCE\\tthat she refused to turn over in her private server...\\t0', '1169\\tQUIJANO\\tSenator Kaine...\\t0', \"1170\\tPENCE\\tand we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about.\\t0\", '1171\\tQUIJANO\\tSenator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action?\\t0', '1172\\tKAINE\\tIf we -- look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat.\\t0', '1173\\tKAINE\\tYou have to.\\t0', '1174\\tKAINE\\tA president has to do that.\\t0', '1175\\tKAINE\\tNow exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action.\\t0', '1176\\tKAINE\\tYou asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea.\\t0', \"1177\\tKAINE\\tI'm on the Foreign Relations Committee.\\t0\", '1178\\tKAINE\\tWe just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea.\\t0', '1179\\tKAINE\\tAnd interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package.\\t0', '1180\\tKAINE\\tOften China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that.\\t0', \"1181\\tKAINE\\tThey're starting to get worried about North Korea, too.\\t0\", '1182\\tKAINE\\tSo they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.\\t0', \"1183\\tKAINE\\tSo we're working together with China, and we need to.\\t0\", \"1184\\tKAINE\\tChina's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate.\\t0\", '1185\\tKAINE\\tHillary understands that very well.\\t0', '1186\\tKAINE\\tShe went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, \"Women\\'s rights are human rights.\"\\t0', \"1187\\tKAINE\\tThey didn't want her to say that, but she did.\\t0\", \"1188\\tKAINE\\tBut she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China.\\t0\", \"1189\\tKAINE\\tAnd that's what it's going to take.\\t0\", '1190\\tKAINE\\tThe thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China.\\t0', \"1191\\tKAINE\\tI'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.\\t0\", '1192\\tQUIJANO\\tAll right.\\t0', \"1193\\tQUIJANO\\tI'd like to turn to our next segment now.\\t0\", \"1194\\tQUIJANO\\tAnd in this, I'd like to focus on social issues.\\t0\", '1195\\tQUIJANO\\tYou have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives.\\t0', '1196\\tQUIJANO\\tCan you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position?\\t0', '1197\\tQUIJANO\\tSenator Kaine?\\t0', \"1198\\tKAINE\\tYeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine.\\t0\", \"1199\\tKAINE\\tIt's an easy one.\\t0\", \"1200\\tKAINE\\tI'm really fortunate.\\t0\", '1201\\tKAINE\\tI grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents.\\t0', '1202\\tKAINE\\tMy mom and dad are sitting right here.\\t0', '1203\\tKAINE\\tI was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City.\\t0', '1204\\tKAINE\\tMy 40th reunion is in 10 days.\\t0', '1205\\tKAINE\\tAnd I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life.\\t0', '1206\\tKAINE\\tI try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life.\\t0', \"1207\\tKAINE\\tBut I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.\\t0\", '1208\\tKAINE\\tFor me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I.\\t0', '1209\\tKAINE\\tBut I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous.\\t0', '1210\\tKAINE\\tAnd so I had to grapple with that.\\t0', '1211\\tKAINE\\tWhen I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty.\\t0', '1212\\tKAINE\\tBut I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion.\\t0', \"1213\\tKAINE\\tI'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law.\\t0\", '1214\\tKAINE\\tAnd if you elect me, I will uphold the law.\\t0', '1215\\tKAINE\\tAnd I was elected, and I did.\\t0', \"1216\\tKAINE\\tIt was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.\\t0\", '1217\\tKAINE\\tThat was a real struggle.\\t0', \"1218\\tKAINE\\tBut I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.\\t0\", '1219\\tQUIJANO\\tGovernor Pence?\\t0', \"1220\\tPENCE\\tWell, it's a wonderful question.\\t0\", '1221\\tPENCE\\tAnd my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am.\\t0', '1222\\tPENCE\\tI was also raised in a wonderful family of faith.\\t0', '1223\\tPENCE\\tIt was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner.\\t0', '1224\\tPENCE\\tBut my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college.\\t0', \"1225\\tPENCE\\tAnd I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since.\\t0\", \"1226\\tPENCE\\tAnd with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish.\\t0\", \"1227\\tPENCE\\tAnd with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith.\\t0\", '1228\\tPENCE\\tI truly do.\\t0', \"1229\\tKAINE\\tThat's shared.\\t0\", '1230\\tPENCE\\tBut for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.\\t0', '1231\\tPENCE\\tThe state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives.\\t0', \"1232\\tPENCE\\tI'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America.\\t0\", \"1233\\tPENCE\\tI think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption.\\t0\", \"1234\\tPENCE\\tBut what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.\\t1\", '1235\\tPENCE\\tI mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.\\t0', \"1236\\tPENCE\\tAnd I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that.\\t0\", \"1237\\tPENCE\\tOr that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion.\\t0\", \"1238\\tPENCE\\tBut Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.\\t0\", '1239\\tPENCE\\tSo for me, my faith informs my life.\\t0', '1240\\tPENCE\\tI try and spend a little time on my knees every day.\\t0', '1241\\tPENCE\\tBut it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.\\t0', '1242\\tKAINE\\tElaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question.\\t0', '1243\\tKAINE\\tHillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.\\t0', '1244\\tKAINE\\tBut we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith.\\t0', '1245\\tKAINE\\tBut it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.\\t0', \"1246\\tKAINE\\tSo let's talk about abortion and choice.\\t0\", \"1247\\tKAINE\\tLet's talk about them.\\t0\", '1248\\tKAINE\\tWe support Roe v. Wade.\\t0', '1249\\tKAINE\\tWe support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy.\\t0', \"1250\\tKAINE\\tThat's something we trust American women to do that.\\t0\", \"1251\\tKAINE\\tAnd we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.\\t0\", '1252\\tKAINE\\tGovernor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade.\\t0', '1253\\tKAINE\\tHe said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history.\\t0', \"1254\\tKAINE\\tAnd we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided.\\t0\", '1255\\tKAINE\\tThis is pretty important.\\t0', '1256\\tKAINE\\tBefore Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.\\t0', '1257\\tKAINE\\tI think you should live your moral values.\\t0', '1258\\tKAINE\\tBut the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices.\\t0', '1259\\tKAINE\\tAnd that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.\\t0', \"1260\\tPENCE\\tNo, it's really not.\\t0\", '1261\\tPENCE\\tDonald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.\\t0', '1262\\tKAINE\\tThen why did Donald Trump say that?\\t0', '1263\\tPENCE\\tWe just never would.\\t0', '1264\\tKAINE\\tWhy did he say that?\\t0', \"1265\\tPENCE\\tWell, look, it's -- look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton.\\t0\", '1266\\tPENCE\\tAnd

pregnancies.\\t0\", \"1300\\tKAINE\\tGovernor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves?\\t0\", '1301\\tKAINE\\tWe can encourage people to support life.\\t0', '1302\\tKAINE\\tOf

what we ought to be doing in public life.\\t0\", '1306\\tKAINE\\tLiving our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day...\\t0', '1307\\tPENCE\\tBecause there are...\\t0', '1308\\tKAINE\\tbut on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions.\\t0', '1309\\tPENCE\\tBecause there is -- a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn.\\t0', '1310\\tPENCE\\tI believe it with all my heart.\\t0', \"1311\\tPENCE\\tAnd I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump.\\t0\", '1312\\tQUIJANO\\tI do have one final question for you both tonight.\\t0', '1313\\tQUIJANO\\tIt has been a divisive campaign.\\t0', '1314\\tQUIJANO\\tSenator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?\\t0', \"1315\\tKAINE\\tThat's a really important one.\\t0\", '1316\\tKAINE\\tThat may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign.\\t0', \"1317\\tKAINE\\tAnd again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump -- and this is -- this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump -- Donald

'1320\\tKAINE\\tHillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state.\\t0', '1321\\tKAINE\\tAnd I served in the Senate.\\t0', \"1322\\tKAINE\\tAnd I'm really amazed,

committees.\\t0', '1325\\tKAINE\\tShe worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana.\\t0', '1326\\tKAINE\\tShe worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon.\\t0', '1327\\tKAINE\\tShe worked to get benefits for -- TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard.\\t0', '1328\\tKAINE\\tShe has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen.\\t0', '1329\\tKAINE\\tAnd, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record.\\t0', '1330\\tKAINE\\tI was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses.\\t0', '1331\\tKAINE\\tAnd in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle.\\t0', \"1332\\tKAINE\\tBecause I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together.\\t0\", '1333\\tKAINE\\tAnd Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.\\t0', '1334\\tQUIJANO\\tGovernor, how will you unify the country if you win?\\t0', '1335\\tPENCE\\tWell, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion...\\t0',

\"1340\\tPENCE\\tWeakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat.\\t0\", '1341\\tPENCE\\tI think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C.\\t0', '1342\\tPENCE\\tYou know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States.\\t0',

going to take leadership to do it.\\t0\", '1345\\tPENCE\\tThe American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again.\\t0', '1346\\tPENCE\\tThey want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again.\\t0', '1347\\tPENCE\\tThey want to see an American comeback.\\t0', \"1348\\tPENCE\\tAnd Donald Trump's entire career has been about building.\\t0\", \"1349\\tPENCE\\tIt's been about -- it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and -- when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America.\\t0\", '1350\\tPENCE\\tWhen you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller.\\t0', \"1351\\tPENCE\\tThey're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it.\\t0\", \"1352\\tPENCE\\tAnd when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long.\\t0\", '1353\\tQUIJANO\\tAll right, gentlemen, thank you so much.\\t0', '1354\\tQUIJANO\\tThis concludes the vice presidential
